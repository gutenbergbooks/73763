<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
PUNISHING A SNEAK
</h3>

<p>
"A million at the bottom of the sea,
father?"
</p>

<p>
"That is what I said, Dave."
</p>

<p>
"It is a fortune!"
</p>

<p>
"There may be more than that.  But I am
sure of the million."
</p>

<p>
"And it would belong to us if we found
it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, every cent of it."
</p>

<p>
"But you say the Hankers lay claim to
the fortune," went on Dave Fearless, a
handsome lad of seventeen, the only son of Amos
Fearless, ex-sea captain and marine architect.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Lemuel Hankers always did claim
the Washington fortune.  His mother, you
know, was a Washington."
</p>

<p>
"But so was your father."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly; and the money was left to our
branch of the family, no matter what the
Hankers may say to the contrary."
</p>

<p>
"And it was shipped from China to San
Francisco in the steamship <i>Happy Hour</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but the <i>Happy Hour</i> belied her
name, for she went down in the middle of the
Pacific with all on board."
</p>

<p>
"And the exact location of this wreck?"
</p>

<p>
"Was not known up to six months ago.
Then the <i>Albatross</i>, making some deep-sea
fishing for the government, came upon some
wreckage which proved conclusively that the
<i>Happy Hour</i> had gone down in the exact spot
which I have marked on the chart here."
</p>

<p>
"Do the Hankers know of this locality?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not.  They were in Europe on a
pleasure tour when the report came in, and it
is very likely that it escaped their notice."
</p>

<p>
"You must be right, for they are very rich,
and if they thought they could add to their
fortunes they would fit out an expedition at
once and go in search of the sunken treasure."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, Dave.  But they would
have their hands full finding it, for you must
remember, the Pacific Ocean at this point is
nearly two miles deep."
</p>

<p>
"Two miles!"  Dave Fearless' face fell.
"Then we'll never see a single piece of that
gold."
</p>

<p>
"I have been thinking of the matter for
several weeks, and I think I have solved the
problem of how to get to the wreck, if I can
work the plan I have in mind," replied
Mr. Fearless, as he began to pace the floor of the
modest dining room thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"And what is your plan, father?"
</p>

<p>
"It is this: Two weeks from to-day our
government is going to send another ship to
the Pacific, the <i>Swallow</i>, under the command
of Captain Paul Broadbeam."
</p>

<p>
"What, dear old Captain Broadbeam,
whom we used to know at Nantucket Light?"
</p>

<p>
"The same, Dave.  He will be in full
charge of the expedition, which is to sound
the depths of the Pacific, locate any new
islands which may be brought to light, and
drag the bottom of the ocean for strange fish
or marine animals, for the Fish Commission.
For this purpose the expedition will take
along one of the new Costell diving bells."
</p>

<p>
"You mean one of those glass cages which
they can lower to the bottom of the ocean and
then walk around on big steel legs, like an
artificial crab?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  They say they work perfectly,
and if that is so, we ought to be able to get to
the wreck of the <i>Happy Hour</i> and explore it
without difficulty."
</p>

<p>
"We?  Shall we go along with Captain
Broadbeam?"
</p>

<p>
"If my application as master diver is
accepted," and Amos Fearless smiled faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Then you've applied for such a position?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I did it as soon as I heard Broadbeam
was in charge.  I know he will do what
he can for me."
</p>

<p>
"And what of me, father?"
</p>

<p>
"If I go, you shall go as assistant."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  Then the sunken treasure is as
good as ours!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too sure, Dave.  Even if we are
successful, there is plenty of work cut out for
us before we lay our hands on that million
dollars, or any part of it.  We must&mdash;what's
that?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Amos Fearless broke off short and ran
to the window of the cottage in which he and
his son lived.  "A fellow running down to
the beach!  He was at the window listening!"
</p>

<p>
"It's Bart Hankers!" burst from Dave's
lips.  "Bart Hankers, of all people!  He
must have heard all we said."
</p>

<p>
"That's too bad!"  Amos Fearless gave
a deep sigh.  "I wanted to keep this a
secret."
</p>

<p>
"The miserable sneak!" went on Dave,
indignantly.  "I'm going after him and see
what he means by such conduct."
</p>

<p>
And before his father could stop him, the
lad was out of the cottage and running
toward the beach at his best speed.
</p>

<p>
As said before, Dave Fearless was a youth
of seventeen, tall, well-built, and handsome.
He had been brought up along the coast of
Long Island Sound, and had spent two years
of his life in a lighthouse not far distant from
his present residence in the village of Quanatack.
</p>

<p>
Following in the footsteps of his father,
Dave had taken to the water naturally, and
no boy on Long Island could swim better, row
better, or handle a sailboat more skillfully
than he.  In addition to this, Dave had often
been with his father when the latter was
working at his trade as a master diver, and
he knew more about the work of a diver than
did many men who followed it for a living.
</p>

<p>
Father and son lived together by
themselves, Mrs. Fearless having died several
years before.  Mr. Fearless had once been
fairly well-to-do, but a fire, and the wild
speculations of a brother, now dead also, had
robbed him of all of his savings and left him
with nothing but his hands to depend upon
for a living.
</p>

<p>
The village in which the Fearlesses lived
was not a large one, but it contained some
people who were very friendly to the master
diver and his son, and also contained some
who were just the opposite.
</p>

<p>
Among the latter were Lemuel Hankers
and his eighteen-year-old son Bart.  The
Hankers were distantly related to the
Fearlesses, but as the latter were poor, the
relationship was never acknowledged by the
former.  Indeed, Bart Hankers took particular
pains to snub Dave Fearless upon every
possible occasion.
</p>

<p>
Some of the snubbings flashed over Dave's
mind as he sped after Bart Hankers, who was
running to where he had left a small boat tied
up at one of the village docks.
</p>

<p>
"I'll show him that he is not to play the
sneak on us, even if he does snub me," muttered
Dave, as he reached the dock, to find
Bart just entering the rowboat.
</p>

<p>
In a minute he was at the stringpiece of
the dock.
</p>

<p>
"Hi, Bart Hankers, I want to talk to
you!" he called out.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want of me, Dave Fearless!"
returned the rich youth, sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"I want to know what you mean by playing
sneak around our house."
</p>

<p>
"Around your house?  I haven't been near
your house."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you have.  You just came from
there."
</p>

<p>
"It's untrue.  I have been up to Radley's
store all the morning."
</p>

<p>
"I saw you and so did my father.  You're
a nice sneak, you are, I must declare.  If I
were you I'd be ashamed of myself."
</p>

<p>
"See here, if you call me a sneak, I'll
punch your head for you, Dave Fearless!"
howled Bart, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are a sneak, so there!"
</p>

<p>
"So you want your head punched, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"If I do, you're not able to do the job."
</p>

<p>
"Won't I?  I'll show you."  And Bart
leaped from the rowboat back to the dock.
</p>

<p>
"You were up under our window listening
to the talk between my father and me."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't so!"
</p>

<p>
"It's the truth."
</p>

<p>
"You say another word and I'll thrash
you within an inch of your life!" howled
Bart, working himself up into a magnificent
rage.
</p>

<p>
"I am not afraid of you," answered Dave,
calmly.  The fact that Bart was two inches
taller than himself and weighed at least
fifteen pounds more did not daunt him.
</p>

<p>
"Will you take back what you said?"
</p>

<p>
"Instead of taking it back, I repeat what
I said&mdash;you are a mean sneak, and I want
everybody in this village to know it,"
answered Dave, in a loud voice.
</p>

<p>
Several boys and a man were fishing near
at hand, and now they drew closer to learn
what was the cause of the trouble.
</p>

<p>
The man, who did some work for Mr. Hankers,
sided with Bart, but the boys all
favored Dave.
</p>

<p>
"Pitch into him, Dave," piped in one of
the smaller lads.  "He puts on too many
airs, he does!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you dare to touch Mr. Hankers,"
put in the man.
</p>

<p>
"I will do as I see fit, Hank Shores,"
retorted Dave.  "Don't you interfere here."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind him, Shores," said Bart,
with a sneer.  "I can handle him well enough
alone, and I'll give him all he wants, too."
</p>

<p>
"A fight! a fight!" exclaimed several of
the boys, and soon a fair-sized crowd
collected on the dock, for, in a village, a fight is
a great event, to be talked over for many a
day afterward.
</p>

<p>
"What's the trouble?" asked several.
</p>

<p>
"Dave Fearless and Bart Hankers are
going to have it out."
</p>

<p>
"What started it?"
</p>

<p>
"Dave says Bart is nothing but a miserable sneak."
</p>

<p>
"You have got to take back what you
said," blustered Bart, squaring off.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take back nothing," retorted Dave.
</p>

<p>
He had scarcely spoken when the rich
youth struck out and landed lightly on his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
As quick as lightning Dave returned the
blow, landing on Bart's nose with just
sufficient force to draw blood.
</p>

<p>
"Ouow!" howled the rich youth, and
staggered back.
</p>

<p>
"First blood for Dave Fearless!"
</p>

<p>
"Give him another like that, Dave!"
</p>

<p>
In a worse rage than ever Bart rushed at
Dave again and this time caught him on the
chin, and nearly knocked him down.
</p>

<p>
"There's one for Bart Hankers!"
</p>

<p>
"He'll down Dave Fearless yet!"
</p>

<p>
As quickly as he could Dave recovered and
rushed at his opponent.
</p>

<p>
Blows now flew thick and fast, and Dave
was hit on the shoulder, on the chest, and on
the cheek.
</p>

<p>
But he returned every blow with interest,
and Bart received a crack in the eye which
made him see a thousand stars, and then
another in the mouth, which loosened two of his
teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he groaned, and staggered toward
the end of the dock.
</p>

<p>
"Have you had enough?" demanded Dave.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
Hardly had Bart answered when Dave
squared off again.  Bart struck out feebly
and Dave warded off the blow with ease.
</p>

<p>
Then Dave's left fist shot out, fairly and
squarely, and the rich youth received a blow
under the chin which lifted him off his feet
and sent him backward with a loud splash
into the waters of Long Island Sound.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE HANKERS' MOVE
</h3>

<p>
"Bart's overboard!"
</p>

<p>
"My! but wasn't that a clever blow!"
</p>

<p>
"Dave is too many for him, even if Bart is
larger."
</p>

<p>
So the cries ran on as all rushed to the edge
of the dock.
</p>

<p>
Bart Hankers had disappeared, but he soon
came up, spluttering and floundering around
in a fashion to make many of those present
laugh.
</p>

<p>
The water at the dock was not extra deep,
and his head had become covered with black
mud from the bottom.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you&mdash;rascal!" he cried, when he
could speak.  "I'll&mdash;I'll have you locked up
for that!"
</p>

<p>
"Locked up!" cried several.  "What for?
It was a fair fight."
</p>

<p>
"Dave had no right to knock him into the
water," put in Hank Shores.
</p>

<p>
Bart Hankers' rowboat was close at hand
and into this the rich boy climbed slowly and
painfully, for he was still partly dazed by the
crack under the chin.
</p>

<p>
His wet and muddy appearance made many
in the crowd laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Bart, you look as if you were
dressed for the ball!" cried one boy.
</p>

<p>
"Now's the time to call on your best girl,
Bart.  You're in good shape for hugging
her," added another.
</p>

<p>
"You fellows shut up!" growled the rich
youth, shaking his fist at them.  "If you don't
I'll make it hot for the lot of you."
</p>

<p>
"About as hot as you made it for Dave
Fearless, eh?" was the reply, and a shout of
derision went up.
</p>

<p>
Then one of the boys began to throw some
fish bait at Bart, and in a minute half a dozen
youths were at it and Bart was struck in
several places.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I must get away from here," he
muttered and then cried to Hank Shores: "Row
me over to Purry's dock, will you, Shores?"
</p>

<p>
"I will," replied Shores, and leaping into
the rowboat, took up the oars.  Soon the craft
was out of reach of those left behind.  But
before Bart got out of hearing he heard the
village lads give a hurrah for Dave Fearless.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Dave Fearless," he muttered,
under his breath.  "You 're on top this time,
but I reckon my father and I will win in the
long run."
</p>

<p>
"He played you foul, Bart," said Shores,
soothingly.  He was little better than a sneak
himself.
</p>

<p>
"He wouldn't have been able to do it only
I&mdash;er&mdash;I sprained my arm at rowing yesterday.
That's why I got you to row for me,"
answered Bart.  But what he said about his
arm was a falsehood.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later Bart Hankers entered
his elegant home at the end of the main street
of the village and sneaked up to the bathroom,
where he washed up and changed his wet
clothing for a dry suit.  Then he went
downstairs and to the library, where his father sat,
reading the stock reports in a New York
paper.
</p>

<p>
"Father, the mystery is solved," he said,
as he closed the door carefully, that nobody
might hear what he had to say but his parent.
</p>

<p>
Lemuel Hankers, a thin, yellow-skinned
man of fifty, looked at his son curiously.
</p>

<p>
"What mystery, Bart?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"The mystery of the missing Washington fortune."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean it!" And the man
leaped from his chair in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"I do mean it."
</p>

<p>
"What have you learned?"
</p>

<p>
"I know where the <i>Happy Hour</i> went down."
</p>

<p>
"Where did you get your information?"
</p>

<p>
"From the Fearlesses."
</p>

<p>
"Do they know?"
</p>

<p>
"They do.  Quite by accident I overheard
Dave and his father talking."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!  Tell me the particulars," went
on Lemuel Hankers.
</p>

<p>
Without a blush Bart related all he had
overheard while eavesdropping at the window
of the Fearless cottage.  Hankers senior
listened with close attention.
</p>

<p>
"It is a shame that we should have missed
this information when it came in," he
muttered.  "We might already be on the way to
recover the fortune."
</p>

<p>
"We ought to try and get that chart," said
Bart.
</p>

<p>
"We won't want the chart.  I can get the
same news from the government that Amos
Fearless has got."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go in search of the sunken treasure,
dad.  It certainly belongs to us."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it does, Bart.  Yes, if this
news is true, I will go after the missing million."
</p>

<p>
"But you will have to take expert divers
along, and all that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
"I can do that easily.  I own stock in the
San Francisco Wrecking Company, and it will
not be difficult for me to charter one of their
vessels, along with all the latest appliances
for raising valuables from the ocean's
depths."
</p>

<p>
"Then wouldn't it be advisable for us to
start at once?"
</p>

<p>
"I must find out the particulars of this
matter first."
</p>

<p>
"How will you do that?"
</p>

<p>
"The easiest way will be to make a trip to
Washington."
</p>

<p>
"Then you had better go to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I will," answered Lemuel Hankers.
</p>

<p>
He was as good as his word, and the next
day found him at Washington.
</p>

<p>
He quickly introduced himself to the proper
parties and from them learned as much as
Amos Fearless knew concerning the location
of the wrecked <i>Happy Hour</i>.  That the ship
had been exactly located there could be no
doubt.  But it was also true that the ocean
currents were gradually shifting the wreck
from one position to another.
</p>

<p>
"If anything is to be done it must be done
soon," he said, upon returning home.  "That
section of the ocean's bed is subject to
earthquakes, and an earthquake might sink the
<i>Happy Hour</i> so that no diver could find her
again."
</p>

<p>
"Then why don't you start for San Francisco
at once?"
</p>

<p>
"I will make up my mind inside of the next
twenty-four hours," answered Lemuel Hankers.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, if you go you'll take me
along," went on Bart.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't thinking of doing so."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to stay behind.  Dave Fearless
is going with his dad."
</p>

<p>
"But they are both expert divers and will
do their own work, while I will have to have
our work hired out."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care.  I want to be on hand to see
the Fearlesses outwitted."
</p>

<p>
"Very well then, you shall go," answered
Lemuel Hankers.
</p>

<p>
The next day saw the rich man and his son
on their way to San Francisco, to fit out an
expedition to hunt for the sunken treasure.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
A STRANGE HOTEL ADVENTURE
</h3>

<p>
"Father, I have news for you!" cried
Dave Fearless, as he rushed into the cottage
all out of breath.
</p>

<p>
"What now, Dave?"
</p>

<p>
"The Hankers have left Quanatack and
gone to San Francisco."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!"
</p>

<p>
"It's true.  They took the train for New
York, and Sam Dilks overheard Bart ask his
father what the tickets to San Francisco
would cost."
</p>

<p>
"That looks bad."
</p>

<p>
"And that isn't the worst of it.  Sam also
overheard them talking about the San
Francisco Wrecking Company and heard Mr. Hankers
say he felt sure he could get the vessel
without delay."
</p>

<p>
"Then they must be after the sunken
treasure beyond a doubt, Dave."  Amos Fearless
gave a slight groan.  "They'll get the start
of us after all!"
</p>

<p>
"How about that job for us on the <i>Swallow</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard nothing new."
</p>

<p>
"If I were you I'd send a long letter to
Captain Broadbeam and let him know just
how we stand."
</p>

<p>
"I will do it."
</p>

<p>
The letter was sent that night, and then the
Fearlesses waited anxiously for a reply.
</p>

<p>
Two days later came a telegram from
Washington.  It was from their old friend the
captain and ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Both engaged at salary mentioned in letter.
Report here without delay."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  We 're in it after all!" shouted
Dave, flinging up his cap, and he danced a jig
for joy.  "Now for the Pacific Ocean and the
missing fortune!"
</p>

<p>
Father and son had prepared everything
for a start from home, and that evening saw
them on the way to Washington.  They spent
the night in New York, and reported at the
Capital City at noon the next day.
</p>

<p>
"Glad to see you," said Captain Broadbeam,
shaking both by the hand.  "Come over
to my hotel and we'll talk matters over."  He
was a round-faced, jolly old sea-dog, and
nobody could help liking him.
</p>

<p>
At the hotel the captain was let into the
secret of the sunken treasure, in which he
immediately took a deep interest.  When
Lemuel Hankers was mentioned he scowled.
</p>

<p>
"He is my enemy," he said.  "He tried to
get me out of my position so that some captain
friend of his could have the berth.  I'd
be glad to knock the wind out o' his sails,
consarn him!"
</p>

<p>
"Where is the <i>Swallow</i> now?"
</p>

<p>
"At San Francisco, all ready to sail."
</p>

<p>
"And when shall we go West?"
</p>

<p>
"Day after to-morrow, and you can go
along with me."
</p>

<p>
A long talk followed, during which Amos
Fearless asked about a diving bell.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we have the very latest pattern on
board of the <i>Swallow</i>," answered Captain
Broadbeam, "and we shall also take along the
very best of diving outfits, deep-sea sounders,
and drag-nets&mdash;better even than those on the
<i>Albatross</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll be fixed to go right ahead,"
said Mr. Fearless.  "But we must get ahead
of Lemuel Hankers and his son."
</p>

<p>
"Trust me to do that, Fearless.  But when
it comes to going down to a wreck as lies two
miles under the surface o' the ocean, why, you
and Dave will have to do that part o' the
job."
</p>

<p>
"And we will," put in Dave, quickly.  "I
know it is a gigantic undertaking, but with;
the proper outfits, I feel convinced that we
will get there sure!" and he shook his head
confidently.
</p>

<p>
In secret Amos Fearless promised Captain
Broadbeam twenty-five per cent. of any sum
recovered from the wreck, providing the
government would allow the officer to accept the
amount.
</p>

<p>
It was not until late that night that the
party separated and Dave and his father
retired to a room in another part of the hotel.
</p>

<p>
When they left Captain Broadbeam, a man
in a room next to the captain's got up from
his knees, for he had been down listening at
the keyhole of a door which connected the
two apartments.
</p>

<p>
This fellow was named Pete Rackley, and
he was in Lemuel Hankers' employ.
</p>

<p>
"I'm onto their game right enough,"
muttered Rackley to himself.  "So they are
going to outwit my boss?  Well, I reckon not."
</p>

<p>
Before going to bed that night, Pete Rackley
wrote a long letter to Lemuel Hankers,
telling the rich man of what he had heard.
</p>

<p>
He felt that he must keep Dave and his
father from going West to join the <i>Swallow</i>,
no matter what the cost.
</p>

<p>
So he at once laid a plan to have Dave
arrested for supposed pocket-picking.
</p>

<p>
The next morning he met Dave in the reading
room, where he had gone to glance over
the newspapers.
</p>

<p>
Unknown to Dave he approached the lad
and dropped into his coat pocket a pocket-book
containing ten dollars and a visiting
card upon which was written his name, Peter
Rackley.
</p>

<p>
Then he walked out into the hallway to the
door of the hotel, stopped suddenly, and gave
a cry:
</p>

<p>
"My pocket-book!  It is gone!"
</p>

<p>
"What's that, sir?" demanded the hotel
clerk, who happened to be passing.
</p>

<p>
"My pocket-book is gone!  It must have
been stolen from me!"
</p>

<p>
"Did it have much in it?"
</p>

<p>
"Ten dollars or more."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you dropped it, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Hardly.  I had it quarter of an hour ago.
when I was in the reading room.  Ha, I have
it!  That young man took it from me."  And
Pete Rackley started back to the reading
room.
</p>

<p>
"What young man?"
</p>

<p>
"The fellow who brushed up so close to me
at the table.  There he is!"  Rackley ran up
to Dave and caught him by the shoulder.
"You thief!" he ejaculated.  "Give me back
my money!"
</p>

<p>
Of course Dave was taken completely by
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Your money?" he repeated.  "I know
nothing of your money."
</p>

<p>
"You must have it.  Sir, will you have him
searched?" went on Pete Rackley to the
clerk.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, he can search me if he
wishes," said Dave, promptly.  "I am no
thief."
</p>

<p>
A few more words followed, and the clerk
began to search Dave.  Soon the pocket-book
was brought to light, much to Dave's
astonishment and dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! what did I tell you!" ejaculated
Pete Rackley.  "Call an officer at once.
I want this young rascal arrested on the
spot!" and he caught hold of Dave again,
that the youth might not escape.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
AN OCEAN MONSTER
</h3>

<p>
Dave knew not what to say.  Here he was
accused of a robbery of which he knew absolutely
nothing.  The very prison doors seemed
opening to receive him.
</p>

<p>
But while he stood there, not knowing what
would happen next, an unexpected friend
stepped up in the shape of a stranger, who
had been reading in a corner.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, but there is something wrong
here," said the stranger.  "That man is no
thief, to my way of thinking."
</p>

<p>
"What do you know of this?" demanded
the hotel clerk.
</p>

<p>
"A short while ago I saw that man come
up behind this young man and slip that
pocket-book into his pocket.  I thought at the
time he was playing some friendly joke, but it
seems he was up to something more serious."
</p>

<p>
At these words Pete Rackley turned deadly
pale.  He was caught in his own trap, and he
knew it.
</p>

<p>
"It's false!" he began.  "I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I saw the action, too," put in another
stranger.  "I thought it very queer."
</p>

<p>
"We'll have the police investigate this,"
said the hotel clerk, and told a hallman to call
an officer of the law.
</p>

<p>
This did not suit Pete Rackley at all.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I guess there is some mistake," he
stammered, and turning, he ran from the
room and from the hotel.  Although he had
left a trunk behind him, he never came back
to claim the property.
</p>

<p>
"That was a queer thing to do," said one
of the strangers to Dave, after the excitement
was over.  "Is he your enemy?"
</p>

<p>
"He must be, but he is a stranger to me,"
answered our hero.
</p>

<p>
The trip to San Francisco was made without
anything special happening, and soon
Dave and his father found themselves on
board of the <i>Swallow</i>, which lay at her dock
taking on the last of her stores for the long
trip around the Pacific Ocean.
</p>

<p>
After a number of inquiries, Amos Fearless
learned that Lemuel Hankers had chartered
the small steamer <i>Raven</i>, from the Wrecking
Company, and had set sail on his treasure
quest the day previous.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, we'll make up for lost time
when once we get started," said Captain
Broadbeam.  "I fancy the <i>Swallow</i> is
a better boat in every way than the <i>Raven</i>."
</p>

<p>
Two days later the <i>Swallow</i> sailed with
Mr. Fearless and Dave on board as master diver
and assistant.
</p>

<p>
The diving outfits on board pleased the
master diver very much, and he was likewise
greatly interested in the diving bell the ship
carried.
</p>

<p>
"That ought to be just the thing for our
work," he said to Dave, "if they can let it
down to where the wreck of the <i>Happy Hour</i>
rests."
</p>

<p>
"But two miles is a tremendous distance,
father."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  I have never yet gone down
over three hundred feet."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we shall fail."
</p>

<p>
"We must try a short distance first, Dave.
We can't go down those two miles at the start.
Captain Broadbeam wishes us to go down
to-morrow anyway, to hunt for some strange
fish, said to be in these waters, a fish known
by the scientific name of Eurypharynx Pelecanoides."
</p>

<p>
"What a fearful name!" muttered Dave.
"Is the fish as bad?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and worse.  The monster is said to
be all of twenty feet long, with a head larger
than a hogshead and a mouth seven feet
across.  Its body and tail are covered with
spines or stickers, and its teeth are like so
many large needles."
</p>

<p>
"Truly an ugly customer to meet," and
Dave shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid he'll be an ugly customer to
bag&mdash;in a net or otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"Are we to use the diving bell?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we are to try it, but we are likewise
to use our diving suits, too&mdash;-just to try both
outfits," returned the master diver.
</p>

<p>
The next day the <i>Swallow</i> reached a section
of the Pacific where the strange fish described
by Amos Fearless was supposed to exist, upon
the bottom of the ocean bed, half a mile below
the surface.
</p>

<p>
Diving suits were brought forth, and
Mr. Fearless and Dave were not long in preparing
to descend.
</p>

<p>
Then the diving bell was adjusted to a long
wire rope and let over the side, and they
entered this.
</p>

<p>
The word was given, and slowly but surely
they descended into the cold and dark depths
of the mighty Pacific.
</p>

<p>
At a distance of two hundred feet the bright
sunshine overhead began to fade away, and
at five hundred feet it was as black as night,
that is, some distance away from the diving
bell.  But around the bell several electric
lights in the apparatus made all as bright as
day.
</p>

<p>
Down and down they went, the pressure
on the diving bell becoming each second more
powerful.
</p>

<p>
At such a depth no human being could have
lived without something to protect him from
a weight which was ever ready to crush
anything from the outside world.
</p>

<p>
At last the diving bell rested on the bottom
of the ocean, and Amos Fearless sent up the
signal to stop lowering.
</p>

<p>
Then father and son inspected the ocean's
bottom with much curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Here were numerous fish of curious shapes,
but none of large size.  There were also sea
crabs, with sharp claws and protruding reddish eyes.
</p>

<p>
But no sign of the Eurypharynx Pelecanoides,
the wonderful fish, of which they had
been sent in search.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to be safe enough," said Dave
to his father, in the sign language of divers.
"Let us go outside and look around."
</p>

<p>
"But not too far away from the diving
bell," answered the master diver.  "The
pressure may make us sick, and then we'll have
to get inside again as quickly as possible."
</p>

<p>
Soon they were ready, and with a fresh supply
of air in their helmets, they stepped out
upon the slimy, black surface of the ocean's
bottom.
</p>

<p>
At sight of them the small fish thrashed
around wildly, and the sea crabs scampered
in all directions.
</p>

<p>
With caution they moved away from the
bell to where the bottom appeared to slope
downward.
</p>

<p>
Here there was a large hole, and they
wondered what might be at its bottom.
</p>

<p>
Dave was well in advance, when of a sudden
a strange sensation brought him to a halt
and made him glance to his left.
</p>

<p>
A shriek of terror burst from his lips.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p28"></a>
The dreadful Eurypharynx Pelecanoides
had appeared, and was making swiftly
towards him.  The terrific mouth of the
monster was wide open, as if to swallow him
alive!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
FROM ONE DANGER INTO ANOTHER
</h3>

<p>
"I am lost!"
</p>

<p>
Such was the agonizing thought which
crossed Dave Fearless' mind when he beheld
himself confronted by the fish known as the
Eurypharynx Pelecanoides, commonly called
the Sea Devil of the Ocean's Bottom.
</p>

<p>
The monster was all of twenty feet long,
with a head closely resembling a black rubber
balloon.  Its eyes shone like two electric-light
globes, while its mouth opened and shut with
a strange, clicking sensation which went
through the young diver like the piercing of a
needle.
</p>

<p>
Dave's thought was to retreat to the diving
bell, but this seemed impossible, for the
monstrous fish was only a few yards off and
approaching rapidly.  It looked as if in another
moment all would be over and he would be
swallowed alive, like Jonah of old.
</p>

<p>
A million thoughts rushed through his
brain&mdash;thoughts of his younger days, of his
happy life around the lighthouse&mdash;and of how
the Hankers might yet triumph over his
father and himself.  In the meanwhile the
monster came closer, and now it emitted from
its mouth a horrible green slime, with which
to cover its victim before swallowing him,
after the manner of its cousin on earth, the
boa constrictor.
</p>

<p>
But at this moment, when the youth seemed
surely lost, something happened as quickly as
it was unexpected, and which changed the
whole course of events.
</p>

<p>
Through the black waters rushed another
fish, long, thin, and exceedingly bony.  From
the snout of this fish stuck a sword-like spear,
fully three feet long, with a point like that of
a dart.
</p>

<p>
This was the Devil's Needle, another monster
of the deep, and dreaded by all other
monsters, for it is the deadly enemy of
everything that crosses its path.
</p>

<p>
There was a strange, hissing sound, a
thrust, and the sword-like spear was thrust
into the side of the Eurypharynx Pelecanoides.
</p>

<p>
It was like sticking into an inflated bladder.
</p>

<p>
The water was at once dyed crimson and
the mighty ocean monster swept back and
then began to thrash around wildly, sending
mud and sand, slime and blood, flying in all
directions.
</p>

<p>
As quickly as it had appeared, the Devil's
Needle now disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Too faint to stand, Dave sank back on the
ocean bottom.
</p>

<p>
But his father was close at hand, and with
rare presence of mind he caught up his son
and carried him to the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
In another moment both were inside of the
machine and had the door bolted.
</p>

<p>
They were now, as they thought, safe from
harm, and Amos Fearless lost no time in turning
the electric light of the diving bell upon
the Sea Devil of the Ocean's Bottom.
</p>

<p>
It was still thrashing around in a circle, but
gradually its struggles became fainter, and at
last it lay quiet.
</p>

<p>
"He's done for," said the parent, in the
divers' sign language.  "I will fasten him to
the bottom of the bell and then signal them on
the ship to haul up."
</p>

<p>
"Be careful," cautioned Dave.  "That
other fish may serve you as he just served that
horrible creature."
</p>

<p>
"We will move the diving bell close to the
dead creature," answered Amos Fearless.
</p>

<p>
This was done without much difficulty, by
means of a set of levers which connected
with the artificial steel claws of the diving
bell.
</p>

<p>
Then Amos Fearless went forth once more,
taking with him a short chain, which he began
to fasten around the slimy and sticky body of
the dead Sea Devil.
</p>

<p>
The job was a nasty one, but this could not
be helped, and therefore he made the best of
it.
</p>

<p>
He had just finished the work when Dave
saw the Devil's Needle again approaching.
</p>

<p>
So far the fish had not seen Mr. Fearless,
but now it spotted him and made a dart forward
as if to thrust the old diver through and
through with that bony sword.
</p>

<p>
Dave's heart leaped into his throat, for he
imagined nothing could save his father from
death.
</p>

<p>
But then came the thought of moving the
diving bell into the fish's path.
</p>

<p>
He grabbed two of the levers and pushed
them down, violently.
</p>

<p>
Acting under the impetus thus given, the
diving bell made a stride forward, directly in
the path of the Devil's Needle.
</p>

<p>
Crash!
</p>

<p>
Full against the steel frame of the bell came
the sword-like spear of the fish.
</p>

<p>
Another crack followed, as the spear was
broken off close to the creature's snout.
</p>

<p>
The great shock stunned the Devil's Needle
and it turned over on its side and sank slowly
to the ocean's bottom.
</p>

<p>
Realizing that something was wrong, Amos
Fearless turned, just in time to witness the
breaking off of the bony spear.
</p>

<p>
He started for the diving bell, then of a
sudden changed his plan of action.
</p>

<p>
One of the diving bell's steel claws lay close
to the Devil's Needle, and this he raised up
and placed over the monster.
</p>

<p>
Dave, inside of the bell, understood, made
the lever work, and immediately the claw
fastened itself around the body of the
half-stunned fish.
</p>

<p>
Then Amos Fearless picked up the broken-off
sword spear and re-entered the bell.
</p>

<p>
In a moment more the signal was given to
rise, and slowly the diving bell went up to the
surface of the ocean, dragging the bodies of
the two deep-sea monsters with it.
</p>

<p>
"A glorious find!" cried Captain Broadbeam,
when the two monsters were hoisted
on board of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but we don't want to make another
such find under the same circumstances,"
answered Amos Fearless.  And then he related
the particulars of the adventure on the bottom
of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
There were two scientists on board of the
ship and they went to work at once to prepare
the bodies of the two fish which had been
caught.
</p>

<p>
"That sword spear can be fastened on
again," said one of the learned gentlemen.
"And then the specimen will be practically
perfect."
</p>

<p>
"Folks at home ought to see them alive,"
said Dave.  "I never saw such a horrible
sight in my life!"
</p>

<p>
"These fish could not live in ordinary
water," was the answer.  "See, the breathing
apparatus on each is already bursting.  They
can only live at a depth of half a mile or more.
If one tried to reach the surface by swimming
upward, it would only be committing suicide."
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite understand the reason for
that, sir."
</p>

<p>
"It is simple, my lad.  You know the air
around us presses us on every inch of our
bodies, and we are built to resist that
pressure.  An ordinary fish is built to resist the
pressure of ordinary water.  Such a fish as
the Sea Devil is built to resist the pressure of
hundreds of pounds to the square inch, and
consequently when it is brought up, the pressure
inside is too great for the pressure outside,
and that destroys the breathing power
of the marine animal," concluded the learned
man.
</p>

<p>
By evening the <i>Swallow</i> was on her way
westward once more and the scientific men
had the specimens almost ready to be placed
in huge tanks of alcohol.
</p>

<p>
So far, nothing had been seen or heard of
the <i>Raven</i>, but a strict watch was kept each
day for the Hankers' vessel.
</p>

<p>
But one more stop was to be made, at the
island of San Murio, and then the <i>Swallow</i>
was to proceed directly for the locality where
the treasure ship <i>Happy Hour</i> had gone
down.
</p>

<p>
Day after day passed and nothing of
importance occurred.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon there was some slight break
in the machinery and the ship had to come to
a stop for a couple of hours while repairs
were being made.
</p>

<p>
It was a hot day and several of the sailors
readily obtained permission to go in swimming.
</p>

<p>
"I think I will join them," said Dave to his
father.  "The water looks cool and tempting."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Dave," was the answer.  "But
take care you don't get a cramp."
</p>

<p>
"If I do, you can bet I'll yell for help,"
laughed the young diver.
</p>

<p>
He was soon in the water and sporting
around to his heart's content.
</p>

<p>
The sailors had allowed one of the small
boats to drift astern, and Dave swam to this
and showed several of them how to make deep
dives and long stretches under the ocean's
surface.
</p>

<p>
The party were in the midst of having a lot
of fun when a thrilling cry came from the
ship.
</p>

<p>
"A shark!  A shark!  Beware of the shark!"
</p>

<p>
All gazed in the direction pointed out, and
saw a huge shark approaching rapidly, as if
prepared to devour one or another of them!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
</h3>

<p>
"We will be devoured!"
</p>

<p>
"Swim for the ship, boys!"
</p>

<p>
"See, he is coming this way!"
</p>

<p>
"Save me, somebody!  Save me!"
</p>

<p>
Such were some of the cries which rang out
as the sailors swam, terror-stricken, in one
direction or another.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the shark came on rapidly.
He was a big creature, with a cruel-looking
mouth and teeth that were equally ugly.
</p>

<p>
At first he turned toward one of the sailors,
who was swimming for the ship.
</p>

<p>
But a rope was thrown to the tar, and this
he grasped and was hauled on board with all
rapidity.
</p>

<p>
Then the shark turned for another of the
sailors.
</p>

<p>
But this fellow was making for the small
boat, and soon he was on board and safe for
the time being.
</p>

<p>
Then the shark turned swiftly and came for
Dave.
</p>

<p>
The youth dove at once, remembering that
a shark can attack under water only with
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
But the boy could not remain under the surface
forever, and at last he had to come up,
this time somewhat closer to the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
But the shark saw him and turned again to
attack the young diver.
</p>

<p>
It was a critical moment, and Dave was
about to give himself up for lost when a shot
rang out, followed by another.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless had been in the cabin when
the shout of "Shark!" was raised.
</p>

<p>
Knowing at once the peril of the situation,
he had caught a gun from the cabin wall and
lost no time in hurrying to the deck.
</p>

<p>
The shark was still ten feet away from
Dave when Mr. Fearless fired.
</p>

<p>
The first bullet struck the monster in the
side, doing little damage.
</p>

<p>
But the shark turned his head to learn what
had hit him and in a twinkle Amos Fearless
discharged the weapon a second time.
</p>

<p>
This time the bullet struck the shark
squarely in the eye and entered the marine
creature's brain.
</p>

<p>
Up leaped the shark, clear above the water,
to fall with a shock that sounded like the
report of a cannon.
</p>

<p>
The water flew in all directions, drenching
all who stood at the rail of the <i>Swallow</i> taking
in the appalling situation.
</p>

<p>
In its death agonies the shark hurled itself
against the ship, lifting its tail clear to the
rail and wrecking a portion of the woodwork.
Then it turned and dove for the small boat.
The sailor on board had just time enough
to leap out and dive, when the marine creature
struck it with all force, smashing the
rowboat to atoms.
</p>

<p>
But that was the last act of the shark.  In
a minute more it was dead, and floated on the
bosom of the ocean close to the ship.
</p>

<p>
A line was thrown to Dave and the sailors,
and all were hauled on board.
</p>

<p>
"My boy!  My boy!" murmured Amos
Fearless.  "What a narrow escape for you!"
</p>

<p>
"You saved my life, father!" replied
Dave.  He could scarcely speak, but the grip
he gave his parent's hand meant a good deal.
</p>

<p>
Some of the sailors wanted to bring the
shark's remains on board, to get the teeth,
and Captain Broadbeam consented, and later
on, the scientists on the <i>Swallow</i> prepared the
skeleton for mounting, to be sent to the
Smithsonian Institution at Washington.
</p>

<p>
It remained very warm, and Captain Broadbeam
looked constantly for a storm.
</p>

<p>
"Almost all ships catch 'em in these
latitudes," he remarked to Dave.  "This may be
a long time a-coming, but it will pay up for
lost time when it does come."
</p>

<p>
In this surmise Captain Broadbeam was
correct.
</p>

<p>
Two days later, while the sun was shining
brightly, there appeared a cloud to the
south-west, scarcely bigger than a man's hand.
</p>

<p>
But the cloud grew larger with great rapidity,
until it covered half the sky, and the
sunlight was shut out and soon all became as
dark, almost, as night.  The wind began to
blow and soon the waves were running higher
and higher.
</p>

<p>
"We must run into the teeth of the storm,"
said the captain, and gave orders to change
the course.
</p>

<p>
Presently it began to rain, and then
followed lightning and thunder which were
almost incessant.
</p>

<p>
"Never saw anything to match it," declared
Dave, as he put on his oilskins and
joined his father on the stern deck.  "This
beats those we had off Long Island all to
pieces!"
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, Dave," answered Amos
Fearless.  "Take good care that you are not
swept overboard."
</p>

<p>
The storm increased in violence until the
<i>Swallow</i> was heaving and pitching as never
before.  At one moment she would be riding
on the top of a very mountain of water, at the
next she would be going down and down into
a tremendous hollow that looked as if it would
swallow up the stanch ship forever.
</p>

<p>
Captain Broadbeam surveyed the storm
with anxiety, for he realized that it was
unusually severe, and threatened the very
existence of his craft.
</p>

<p>
The lightning played all around the metalwork
of the ship, and the roar of the thunder
was deafening.
</p>

<p>
"You had better go below," said the captain
to Dave and his father.  "You can do
nothing on deck."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we will go below," answered Amos
Fearless.  "Come, my son," and he led the
way down into the cabin.
</p>

<p>
All of the ports and doors had been closed,
and the air was stifling in the shut-up apartment,
but of this there was no use to complain.
</p>

<p>
All crockery, glassware, and other loose
objects had long since been secured, or they
would have been flung in every direction.
</p>

<p>
Dave sat down in a chair screwed to the
floor, and did his best to keep his seat.
</p>

<p>
At one moment he felt like pitching forward,
at the next he seemed about to turn a
back somersault.
</p>

<p>
The electric light burned dimly, for the
electricity in the air had affected the circuit.
</p>

<p>
"We can be thankful when we are out of
this," observed Mr. Fearless, as he, too, clung
to a chair.  "I never dreamed it could blow
so hard and keep it up.  In our eastern storms
there is generally a lull every few minutes."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if the <i>Raven</i> is in this, father?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no telling.  This storm-center
may be but a few miles in diameter."
</p>

<p>
"I am almost tempted to wish the <i>Raven</i>
at the bottom of the ocean."
</p>

<p>
"That wouldn't be right, Dave."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  But supposing they get ahead
of us and the Hankers scoop in the
Washington fortune?"
</p>

<p>
"Then we will have to pocket our loss and
make the best of it."
</p>

<p>
"But our claim is better than theirs."
</p>

<p>
"Morally, yes.  But you must remember
that legally the fortune will belong to whoever
finds it, for it was abandoned at sea many
years ago."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that is so."
</p>

<p>
"For my part, Dave, I believe that neither
of us will have an easy job to obtain the
fortune.  It is going to be a great task to even
reach the sunken wreck."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know that.  But the diving bell will
help us."
</p>

<p>
"It will help a great deal.  But you must
remember the wreck may be turned over, or
buried almost out of sight in the mud of the
ocean bottom.  In that case we'll have a lot
of work to do before any of us can get into the
ship and even locate the lost treasure."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, father, the amount to be
gained will be well worth all the trouble we
will take to gain it."
</p>

<p>
"To be sure, for such a vast sum isn't
picked up more than once in a lifetime, even
at the best.  We can be certain&mdash;Heavens! what's
that?"
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless broke off short, and with
good reason.
</p>

<p>
A fearful shock had come, as a bolt of lightning
struck the forward works of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
Then followed a strange hissing as the
lightning played over the electric wires of the
ship.
</p>

<p>
A blinding flash entered the cabin, followed
by a crack as of a pistol, and Dave, half
stunned, saw his father pitch forward across
the table like one dead!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
"I CANNOT TALK!"
</h3>

<p>
"Father!  Tell me that you are alive!
That you are not dead!"
</p>

<p>
Such was the agonizing cry which issued
from Dave's lips as he gazed upon his
parent.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless' face was like chalk, his
eyes were set, and he certainly looked as
if the breath of life had gone from him forever.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Swallow</i> was rolling and pitching so
fearfully that for the time being the young
man could do but little.
</p>

<p>
Yet he raised a cry which quickly brought
the cabin boy to his side.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" asked the boy, and then,
seeing the stilled form, he continued: "Is
he dead?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I hope not.  But send Doctor Barrell
here at once."
</p>

<p>
Doctor Barrell was one of the scientists
attached to the expedition.  He was a learned
man, and Dave felt certain that if anything
could be done for his parent, Doctor Barrell
could do it.
</p>

<p>
The cabin boy went off with difficulty, and
it was fully ten minutes before he returned
with the medical man.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Dave laid his parent on
the floor.
</p>

<p>
By placing his ear to his parent's breast,
he found that his father still breathed
faintly.
</p>

<p>
He was just pouring water over the
sufferer's face when Doctor Barrell came in.
</p>

<p>
"What is the trouble?" he asked.  "Has
he had a tumble?  I do not wonder; I have
tumbled twice myself."
</p>

<p>
"No, he has been struck by lightning, doctor.
Please do all you can for him."
</p>

<p>
"Struck by lightning!  In here?  How?"
</p>

<p>
"The lightning entered on the electric-light
wire and he got the full force of the
shock.  I was partly stunned myself."
</p>

<p>
"I don't wonder.  You can thank your stars
that both of you are not dead."
</p>

<p>
"But my father?"
</p>

<p>
Before replying to this query, Doctor
Barrell proceeded to make a thorough examination.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of this, Amos Fearless opened
his eyes and stared around him, feebly.
</p>

<p>
But he could not move his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"He will live," said the doctor, slowly.
"But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But what, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"He may not be able to&mdash;that is, he has
had a very heavy shock."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes!  But what will he not be able to
do?" questioned Dave, quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I had better not answer that
question just yet, David.  There is no use of
alarming you," and the physician turned
away to prepare some medicines for the sufferer.
</p>

<p>
The night to follow was an anxious one to
Dave.
</p>

<p>
Despite the storm, which did not let up for
an instant, he remained constantly by his
parent's side.
</p>

<p>
It was daybreak before Amos Fearless was
pronounced out of danger.
</p>

<p>
He still lay in a semi-dazed condition, but
his heart-beats were growing stronger every
hour.
</p>

<p>
"In a few days he will probably be able to
be around," said the doctor, and then he
turned away to hide his troubled looks from
Dave.
</p>

<p>
The youth saw the action and was more
worried than ever.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the storm had abated and something
could be cooked, he had a bowl of
nourishment made for his father.
</p>

<p>
The sufferer swallowed a few spoonfuls,
and that was all, and even that little went
down with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"Do you feel better, father?" he asked,
soothingly.
</p>

<p>
Slowly Amos Fearless nodded.  His lips
moved slightly, but no intelligible sound came
from them.
</p>

<p>
"Don't try to talk," went on the boy.
"Take it easy and you will be yourself in a
few days."
</p>

<p>
Again Mr. Fearless nodded, and then fell
back, to doze off again.
</p>

<p>
The next day he was strong enough to sit
up.  The storm was now over and the <i>Swallow</i>
was proceeding on her way to the island at
which she was to stop.
</p>

<p>
"You are better now, surely," said Dave,
speaking as cheerfully as he could.
</p>

<p>
For answer, Amos Fearless pointed to his
mouth and then made a motion as if writing
on paper.
</p>

<p>
A sudden horror seized Dave, causing a
cold chill to run down his backbone.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he cried.  "Oh, father,
can't you speak?"
</p>

<p>
Again the old diver made a motion as if
writing, and Dave hurriedly brought him a
pencil and a writing pad.
</p>

<p>
Quickly Amos Fearless set down the following:
</p>

<p>
"My tongue is paralyzed and I cannot talk."
</p>

<p>
As Dave read the words, his very heart
seemed to stop beating.
</p>

<p>
His father had become a mute!
</p>

<p>
The shock was an awful one.
</p>

<p>
He turned to the doctor, who had just come in.
</p>

<p>
"See what my father has written!" he
cried.  "Oh, doctor, cannot something be
done?"
</p>

<p>
"It is what I feared," replied Doctor Barrell,
gravely.  "I have known of such cases
before.  I had such a case to treat in
Richmond, about six years ago."
</p>

<p>
"And the sufferer&mdash;does he talk now?"
was Dave's eager question.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Barrell shook his head, slowly.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry to say he does not, although in
every other respect he is a perfectly healthy
man."
</p>

<p>
"But my father&mdash;cannot you give me some hope?"
</p>

<p>
"Let us hope for the best, David."
</p>

<p>
"You will do all you can for him?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure I will."
</p>

<p>
The day was a perfect one, but Dave was
utterly downcast and refused to be comforted.
</p>

<p>
The thought that his parent might remain
a mute forever almost unnerved him.
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather lose the sunken treasure," he
groaned to himself.
</p>

<p>
At nightfall the <i>Swallow</i> came in sight of
the island of San Murio, and dropped anchor
in a little bay surrounded by palms and other
tropical trees.
</p>

<p>
The scene was a beautiful one, and had
Dave's mind been free from care he would
have enjoyed it thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless was brought on deck and
made comfortable in a steamer chair.
</p>

<p>
He was gaining strength rapidly, and the
doctor expected the old diver to be around
again in a week or ten days.
</p>

<p>
But he could not use his tongue for talking
purposes, although he had little trouble in
swallowing food.
</p>

<p>
Early the next morning some of the sailors
from the <i>Swallow</i> were sent ashore for water.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't mind going," said Dave, in
reply to a question from Captain Broadbeam.
"But I hate to leave father."
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless overheard this and at once
wrote on a pad:
</p>

<p>
"Go, Dave, and have a good time.  I'll be
all right.  This will be your last chance to
stretch your legs on shore for many weeks to
come."
</p>

<p>
So the young diver went ashore with the
men, and while the sailors filled their water
casks, Dave and a young engineer of the ship,
named Bob Vilett, went off on a hunt, taking
with them a shotgun and a rifle.
</p>

<p>
They had heard that numerous wild goats
lived upon the island of San Murio, and
thought to bag several of these by way of
diversion.
</p>

<p>
"And who knows but what we'll bring
down something larger, too!" said Bob
Vilett, who was in his way quite a sportsman.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Swallow</i> was to remain at her anchorage
until the next morning, so the pair had
the whole day before them.  Dave carried a
pouch full of food, and Bob a good-sized water
bottle, so that they were well provided, even
if they did not bring down anything worth
eating.
</p>

<p>
"Take good care of yourselves," said Captain
Broadbeam, on parting with them.
"Don't run into danger."
</p>

<p>
"We'll be careful," answered Dave, and off
the pair set, never dreaming of the strange
adventure and the grave peril in store for
them.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
A DISASTROUS HUNT
</h3>

<p>
The island of San Murio is not over six
miles wide by twenty miles long.  It is composed
of two lines of hills, with a deep valley
between.  The hills are rocky and much
broken, and there are numerous waterfalls
and tiny brooks, as well as cliffs and caverns.
The growth of trees and underwood is dense,
and Dave and his friend had frequently all
they could do to push their way along.
</p>

<p>
Both were in fine spirits, and Bob was
inclined to burst into song, only Dave silenced
him.
</p>

<p>
"If you sing you'll surely scare all the
game away," he said.  "A wild goat will hear
your voice half a mile off."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, Dave," returned Bob,
"However, I can't repress my spirits when
I'm ashore.  It's so much better than being
down in the hot and stuffy engine room of a
steamship," and Bob threw down his rifle and
made a handspring or two, after which he
resumed his walk, feeling better.
</p>

<p>
A half-hour's journey brought them close
to the top of the first series of hills, at a point
opposite a small inland lake.
</p>

<p>
"Go slow now," whispered Bob.  "There
may be goats beyond."
</p>

<p>
They peered over the top of the hill with
care, and sure enough, down at the lake shore
they made out two large goats and two kids,
all drinking.
</p>

<p>
"Take the one to the right, and I'll take the
one to the left!" said Bob, in a low voice.
"Ready?  Then fire!"
</p>

<p>
Crack! bang! went the rifle and the
shotgun, and both of the large goats were seen
to leap up and back as though struck.
</p>

<p>
But neither was fatally wounded, and both
started to run slowly around the lake shore,
to the line of hills on the opposite side, with
the kids following.
</p>

<p>
"Come, we had better go after 'em!" ejaculated
Bob, and led the way, and Dave followed,
both reloading as they ran.
</p>

<p>
It was no easy task to reach the lake front,
and by that time the goats were rushing up
the hills opposite.
</p>

<p>
"Fire again!" cried Dave, and blazed
away, bringing his game to its knees.  Bob
also fired, but missed his mark.  Then on they
went again, over rocks and stubble and
through a mass of trailing vines, to where
Dave's goat had gone down.  The animal was
dead.
</p>

<p>
"Good for you!" cried Bob.  "Now I
must do as well!" and away he went again,
with Dave at his heels, anxious, if possible,
to add the kids to his bag.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the second line of hills the
wounded goat made a sharp turn to the
left.
</p>

<p>
On went the young hunters after him, never
dreaming of the pitfall into which they were
rushing.
</p>

<p>
They were now side by side, and Bob was
on the point of blazing away at the wounded
goat, in full view before him, when Dave
clutched his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Back!"
</p>

<p>
"What's up?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing's up, but we'll be down if we
don't take care!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
Before Dave could reply, Bob saw what had
caused the young diver to become alarmed.
</p>

<p>
They were walking over some moss and
brushwood, and the mass under their feet was
shaking like so much jelly.
</p>

<p>
Both started to retreat, but it was too late!
Down went the mass of brushwood, at first
slowly and then swifter and swifter.
</p>

<p>
They tried to clutch at the sides of the
opening, but in vain.  Everything they
grasped gave way&mdash;sticks, moss, stones,
bushes, vines.  Nothing could stop that
downward course.
</p>

<p>
The moss was dry and the dust filled their
eyes, almost blinding them.
</p>

<p>
"We are lost!" gasped Bob, and then the
dust got into his throat and he began to cough
as though choking.
</p>

<p>
In the excitement of the moment, Dave's
shotgun went off, the charge passing directly
between him and his companion.
</p>

<p>
After falling about twenty feet, the mass of
brushwood became wedged tight for a
moment, and stopped descending.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" came from Dave.  "Now we are in
a pickle.  How are we to get out?"
</p>

<p>
For the moment they scarcely dared to move.
</p>

<p>
Then Bob took a step forward and the
young diver did the same.
</p>

<p>
Instantly the mass began to sink once
more, at first slowly and then as rapidly as
ever.
</p>

<p>
Down they went&mdash;thirty feet, forty, fifty,
sixty&mdash;a hundred, until the top of the hole was
lost to sight and they found themselves they
knew not where.
</p>

<p>
Again the brushwood and moss became
wedged fast.  But now they did not dare to
move for fear of dislodging it once more.
</p>

<p>
"We are lost!" came from the engineer.
"We'll never get out of this alive!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't give up yet," answered Dave,
bravely, yet his heart felt like a lump of lead
in his bosom.
</p>

<p>
"Where can we be?"
</p>

<p>
"Down in a mighty deep hole."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  But is this the bottom?"
</p>

<p>
"There's no telling.  We might&mdash;we are
going down again!"
</p>

<p>
It was true.  They were again descending,
but now slowly, as if the passage below was
growing smaller.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we ever stop!" groaned Dave.
</p>

<p>
"It's all up with us!" came from Bob.
"We won't be able&mdash;gracious!  Water!"
</p>

<p>
The young engineer was right.
</p>

<p>
The mass of brushwood had reached the
level of some water at the bottom of the hole.
</p>

<p>
Down they sank, into this.  First up to their
ankles, then to their knees, then to their
waists.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be drowned!" cried Dave.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like it," gasped Bob.  "Heaven
save us!"
</p>

<p>
Soon the water was up to their necks and
still the stuff under them continued to sink.
</p>

<p>
Were they to be drowned like rats in a trap?

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
A PRISONER UNDERGROUND
</h3>

<p>
"What's to do now?"
</p>

<p>
The question came from Bob Vilett.
</p>

<p>
The sinking of the brushwood had ceased,
and he and Dave found themselves in water
almost up to their chins, in absolute darkness.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know, Bob," was the
young diver's response.  "We are in a tight
box, and no mistake."
</p>

<p>
"We can't stay here forever."
</p>

<p>
"True, but if we make a move we may sink
deeper than ever, and then it will be all up
with us."
</p>

<p>
A dead silence of several minutes followed.
Presently both of the lads grew desperate.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to do something, that's certain,"
Dave began, when of a sudden the driftwood
sank once more, and they found themselves
struggling wildly in the black waters
at the bottom of the hole.
</p>

<p>
They were soon over their heads, and now
found a strong current carrying them they
knew not where.  They had hold of each other,
but soon the force of the water wrenched them
apart.
</p>

<p>
Down and down went Dave, and turned
over half a dozen times.
</p>

<p>
He felt as if he must be journeying toward
the center of the earth, when he reached
out his hand and struck a series of smooth
rocks.
</p>

<p>
He tried to hold fast, but this was impossible,
and in a twinkle he turned over again,
and then his feet struck on something of a
sandy beach.
</p>

<p>
Hardly knowing what he was doing, he
stepped forward, and then found himself clear
of the water.
</p>

<p>
This set him to running, and on he went
until he brought up with much force against a
stone wall, and fell back partly stunned.
</p>

<p>
His feet lay in the water, but his head was
on the sand, and thus he remained for fully a
quarter of an hour, unable to move.
</p>

<p>
There was a strange ringing in his ears, and
when he at last arose his head ached as if it
would split open.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he groaned, and staggered up the
sand to the smooth, rocky wall.
</p>

<p>
Then he fell again, and did not move until
half an hour later, when his head felt
somewhat better.
</p>

<p>
Where was he, and how could he save himself?
</p>

<p>
These questions were easy to ask, but no
answer was at hand, and he sank down much
disheartened.
</p>

<p>
Then he suddenly roused himself and called
loudly:
</p>

<p>
"Bob!  Bob Vilett!  Where are you?"
</p>

<p>
Again and again his voice was raised, but
only a dismal echo answered him.
</p>

<p>
Was his late companion dead?
</p>

<p>
It was more than likely.
</p>

<p>
The tears sprang unbidden to the young
diver's eyes, but he dashed them away.
</p>

<p>
He must save himself, no matter what the cost.
</p>

<p>
He realized that he had been saved from
death by drowning only because he was used
to being under water a long time without
taking a breath.
</p>

<p>
All divers practice this art, for possible use
should anything become the matter with their
diving outfits while at work.
</p>

<p>
He felt in his clothing and found his waterproof
matchbox still safe.
</p>

<p>
Soon he had a tiny light, and seeing some
dry driftwood at hand he set it on fire.
</p>

<p>
The blaze threw grotesque shadows on the
rocky walls around him, but revealed nothing
to his gaze but those same walls and the silent,
underground stream flowing between them.
</p>

<p>
He was entombed alive!
</p>

<p>
Gradually this conviction forced itself upon
him, causing him to shiver as if with the
ague.
</p>

<p>
Again he called out the name of his late
companion, and again only the dull echoes
answered him.
</p>

<p>
He reckoned that he must be at least a
hundred yards from the hole made by the sunken
driftwood.
</p>

<p>
To get back to the hole, therefore, was out
of the question.
</p>

<p>
He thought the matter over for a while, and
then, taking up some driftwood for a torch,
walked slowly along the sandy shore of the
black stream.
</p>

<p>
Presently he came to a bend, and here found
that the stream shot downward, forming an
underground waterfall.
</p>

<p>
"I can't go in that direction," he reasoned.
"I want to go up, not down."
</p>

<p>
The stream was less than twelve feet wide,
and did not run so swiftly but what he could
cross it without much danger.
</p>

<p>
Obtaining a fresh firebrand, for the first
was now burnt out, he swam over to the
opposite shore and began an investigation on
that side.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!"
</p>

<p>
The exclamation escaped from his lips
involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
The firebrand had dropped from his hand
into the stream, leaving him in darkness.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the rocks, he had beheld a thin
shaft of light striking down from some opening above.
</p>

<p>
"An opening!  May it prove a way of escape!"
</p>

<p>
With a prayer for aid on his lips, Dave
began to climb the rocks as best he could until
he reached a hollow ten feet above the stream.
Here the light was stronger, and by applying
his eyes to a long, narrow slit in the rocks
he made out a broad cave beyond, the further
end of which was wide open to the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
But how was he to get into the cave?
</p>

<p>
The opening was not over six inches wide,
too narrow for the passage of his body.
</p>

<p>
The rocks were large, weighing several
hundreds of pounds apiece.
</p>

<p>
To move them would take tools, and he had
nothing.
</p>

<p>
Again in a state bordering on despair, he
sat down to review his situation.
</p>

<p>
At last he leaped up, and clenching his
hands, cried loudly:
</p>

<p>
"I must get out!  I simply must!"
</p>

<p>
The cry was an inspiration, for, getting on
his knees, he felt around and found that two
of the big rocks were unsteady upon their
resting places.
</p>

<p>
He pulled away at the smaller stones
beneath, and soon had them loosened.
</p>

<p>
He continued his labors, and presently, with
a mighty crash, one of the rocks slid down
into the stream, disappearing beneath the
surface with a splash.
</p>

<p>
At once the light from beyond shot into the
opening.  He was free!
</p>

<p>
His heart gave a bound of joy, and quickly
he scrambled through the hole and into the
cave beyond.
</p>

<p>
This was a large affair, being at least forty
feet wide and high, and several hundred feet
long.
</p>

<p>
"Now, if only Bob were safe, all would be
well," thought the young diver.
</p>

<p>
Without waiting to light another torch he
began to move toward the outer opening of
the cave.
</p>

<p>
But before he had gone half the distance he
came to a halt with a cry of dismay.
</p>

<p>
The cave was crossed by another underground
stream, all of twenty feet wide, and
flowing onward with tremendous swiftness.
</p>

<p>
It came out from under one rocky wall and
disappeared under the wall opposite.
</p>

<p>
Taking a bit of driftwood, Dave threw it
into the water, and it flashed out of sight
instantly.
</p>

<p>
"I can't swim across that," he thought,
dismally.  "To attempt it would be foolhardy."
</p>

<p>
Now what was to be done?
</p>

<p>
He examined the walls carefully.
</p>

<p>
They were perfectly smooth, thus affording
hold for neither foot nor hand.
</p>

<p>
"If the stream weren't quite so wide I
might jump it," he reasoned.  "But I&mdash;somebody
is coming!"
</p>

<p>
He was right; somebody was entering the
cave from the outer end.
</p>

<p>
The newcomers were two men, one dressed
in the suit of an American business man and
the other in the garb of a sailor.
</p>

<p>
"We'll be alone here and can talk the
matter over without fear of interruption," said
one of the pair, the man in ordinary clothes.
</p>

<p>
His voice sounded strangely familiar, and
Dave strained his eyes to catch a better sight
of him and of his companion.
</p>

<p>
Then, astonished beyond measure, the
young diver dropped out of sight behind a
rock bordering the underground stream he
had been trying to cross.
</p>

<p>
The newcomers were Lemuel Hankers, the
man who had set sail in the <i>Raven</i> after the
sunken treasure, and Pete Rackley, the rascal
who in Washington had accused Dave of robbing him!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
DAVE OVERHEARS A PLOT
</h3>

<p>
"They are here for no good purpose!"
</p>

<p>
Such was the thought which crossed Dave's
mind immediately after making his
astonishing discovery.
</p>

<p>
As much as he wished to be saved from his
present direful situation, he resolved to keep
his presence a secret.
</p>

<p>
These men were his enemies, and by instinct
he felt that Pete Rackley must be Lemuel
Hankers' tool.
</p>

<p>
"I'll wager old Hankers had him try that
game on me in Washington," thought the
young diver.  "It was done so that I couldn't
join the <i>Swallow</i> at San Francisco, and that
father might remain behind, too, to get me
out of the scrape."
</p>

<p>
Presently Lemuel Hankers and Pete Rackley
came so close that Dave could hear all
that was said with ease.
</p>

<p>
"It is a surprise to me that the <i>Swallow</i>
stopped here," Lemuel Hankers was saying.
"Do you think she was following us!"
</p>

<p>
"Can't say as to that," replied Rackley,
puffing away at a short pipe he was carrying.
"Anyway, she's here.  Now what is your
game?  Out with it."
</p>

<p>
"The game is that I don't want the
Fearlesses to get at the sunken treasure,
Pete."
</p>

<p>
"I've heard that before, Lemuel."
</p>

<p>
"You have always been my right-hand
man, Pete, and I know I can rely on you yet,
even though you did make a fizzle of that
affair in Washington."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know I was being spotted,"
growled the sailor, for such Pete Rackley
really was.
</p>

<p>
"My game is that you go aboard of the
<i>Swallow</i> and ship with Captain Broadbeam.
Tell him you are a castaway, and have been
here nearly a year."
</p>

<p>
"But young Fearless knows me."
</p>

<p>
"You can dye your face and your hair and
he won't recognize you, I am sure.  In that
sailor rig you don't look like the man you
were in Washington in a light suit and a linen
shirt."
</p>

<p>
"That's true, too.  But after I am on the
<i>Swallow</i> I don't see what I can do to keep
them from going ahead to where the treasure
is."
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you what to do.  Wait until
you are about a day out from here and then
watch your chance and disable the machinery,
so that they will have to put back for repairs.
When the machinery is repaired, injure the
rudder, and that will bring them back again.
Keep that up for about a month, and the
treasure will be mine, and if I get it, you shall
have ten thousand dollars in cold cash for
your work."
</p>

<p>
"It's taking a big risk," answered Pete
Rackley, slowly.
</p>

<p>
"And so is ten thousand dollars a big sum
of money, Pete.  It's more than you'll ever
get by working, and you know it."
</p>

<p>
"That's true, too."
</p>

<p>
"And if you are sly about it, you'll run
very little risk of detection."
</p>

<p>
"But how will I get on board of the <i>Raven</i>
again?"
</p>

<p>
"After you have kept the <i>Swallow</i> behind
a month you can let her go and desert, hiding
in the woods so that they can't find you.  You
can provide yourself with plenty of food.  As
soon as we have the treasure on board of the
<i>Raven</i>, I'll come back for you and take you
on board."
</p>

<p>
"You won't desert me!"
</p>

<p>
"I will not.  More than that, I'll take
Captain Nesik into the secret with me, and I'll
leave behind all of my diamonds and my
gold watch as an evidence of my good
faith."
</p>

<p>
"Leave your boy Bart here for company
and I'll take you up, Hankers."
</p>

<p>
"I would even do that, Pete, but you know
well enough Bart won't stay behind.  He is
crazy to get the treasure and crow over the
Fearlesses.  He even says he is going down
himself, in that new diving bell we brought
along&mdash;just to show that he can work under
water as well as Dave Fearless."
</p>

<p>
"Then you must leave me all the stuff you
can, and you and Captain Nesik must promise
on your bended knees to come back for me.
I wouldn't be marooned for twice ten
thousand dollars."
</p>

<p>
"It will be all right.  You can&mdash;hullo, who
is calling?"
</p>

<p>
A form had appeared at the mouth of the cave.
</p>

<p>
"Are you in there, dad?" came the cry.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Bart," answered Lemuel Hankers.
He turned to Pete Rackley.  "Come, quick!
Do you accept my offer?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," answered the rascally sailor, and
the pair of villains shook hands.
</p>

<p>
"What are you up to!" went on Bart
Hankers, as he came closer.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we were just taking a look around,"
replied his father, carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know that the <i>Swallow</i> is in this
port?" went on Bart, as he drew closer to
the underground stream.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I wish she was at the bottom of the
Pacific, and the Fearlesses with her."
</p>

<p>
"You should not be so hard on them,"
replied Lemuel Hankers, hypocritically.
</p>

<p>
At this Pete Rackley gave a harsh laugh.
</p>

<p>
"You're a good one," he remarked in a
low tone.
</p>

<p>
"Hush; I don't want my son to know too
much," whispered Lemuel Hankers.
</p>

<p>
By this time Bart Hankers was standing
on the edge of the underground stream.
</p>

<p>
"Wish I could cross over and see what's
on the other shore," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
So far Dave had kept silent, drinking in
all that was said.
</p>

<p>
He realized only too well what a plot was
going on against his father and himself, and
against the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
"If only I can get free, I'll show them a
trick or two," he told himself.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Bart Hankers uttered a cry.
</p>

<p>
"A snake!  A snake!"
</p>

<p>
He was right; a long snake had appeared
at the top of the underground stream.
</p>

<p>
It was a dangerous-looking reptile, eight
feet long, and with nasty green eyes.
</p>

<p>
Bart Hankers fell back in confusion.
</p>

<p>
But instead of climbing to the outer bank,
the snake crawled out close to the rock behind
which Dave was in hiding.
</p>

<p>
It was against human nature to remain
hidden under the circumstances, and the
young diver leaped up with all rapidity.
</p>

<p>
At the same time he yelled at the snake,
and the reptile, much startled, dropped back
into the stream and was lost to view.
</p>

<p>
"Dave Fearless!" gasped Bart Hankers,
as soon as the danger from the snake was
past.
</p>

<p>
"That boy!" came from Lemuel Hankers
and Pete Rackley in a breath.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is I," answered the young diver,
boldly.
</p>

<p>
"How did you get here?" demanded Lemuel
Hankers, much disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
"Tumbled."
</p>

<p>
"Tumbled?"
</p>

<p>
"That is what I said, Lemuel Hankers.
Have you any objection to my being here?"
</p>

<p>
"You followed us.  You have been playing
the part of a spy!" cried the rich man.
</p>

<p>
"How could I have followed you, seeing
that I am on this side of the stream?"
</p>

<p>
"You leaped over."
</p>

<p>
"No, he couldn't do that, dad," interposed
Bart.  "He must have come in some other
way."
</p>

<p>
"You overheard our talk?"
</p>

<p>
"I did."
</p>

<p>
At this Pete Rackley emitted a low whistle.
</p>

<p>
"In that case our cake is dough," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"Not if I know it," muttered Lemuel
Hankers, savagely.  "Do you think I am to
be worsted by a mere boy?"  And he shook
his fist at Dave.
</p>

<p>
All three of the young diver's enemies came
to the edge of the stream.
</p>

<p>
"How did you get where you are?"
repeated Lemuel Hankers.
</p>

<p>
"As I said before, I tumbled."
</p>

<p>
"You are trying to poke fun at me."
</p>

<p>
"I was never more serious in my life."
</p>

<p>
"You think you are smart," put in Bart.
</p>

<p>
"What I think is none of your business."
</p>

<p>
"We'll make it our business," burst out
Lemuel Hankers, wrathfully.  "Come over
here, and come instantly."

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
FACING A JAGUAR
</h3>

<p>
Dave was surprised.  He had not dreamed
that Lemuel Hankers would carry his
highhandedness so openly.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot come over," he said.
</p>

<p>
"And why not?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot leap the distance."
</p>

<p>
"Then swim across."
</p>

<p>
"The current is too strong.  Besides, I
have no more wish for your company than
for the company of that snake which just
disappeared."
</p>

<p>
"Boy, you are a&mdash;a young scamp!" burst
from Lemuel Hankers' lips.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, but I don't wish any of your
backhanded compliments, Lemuel Hankers.
I am not half as much of a scamp as you are
a villain."
</p>

<p>
"A villain?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I said."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you dare to call my dad names,"
put in Bart, shaking his fist across the
stream.
</p>

<p>
"I overheard your plot," went on Dave,
ignoring Bart.  "It's a pretty piece of
business for a gentleman to propose."
</p>

<p>
At this Lemuel Hankers grew red and then
pale.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you know too much, boy," he faltered.
"Come over here, I say.  Or shall I
bring you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how you are going to bring
me.  You can't get over the stream any better
than I can."
</p>

<p>
"It's running very strong, dad,"
announced Bart, who had been testing the
current with some chips.  "I don't believe
anybody can get across without a long plank.  He
must have gotten into the cave from the other
end."
</p>

<p>
"Then we can get in that way, too," put
in Pete Rackley.  "We ought to make him a
prisoner," he added, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you will get in," thought
Dave.  "If you do, the chances are you won't
come out alive."
</p>

<p>
A short talk followed, which Dave could
not hear.
</p>

<p>
Then Pete Rackley left the cave on a run,
to reappear a few minutes later with a good-sized
tree limb which the storm of a few days
before had brought down.
</p>

<p>
"Now we'll get him!" cried Rackley, and
threw the limb over the stream.
</p>

<p>
Dave was much startled.  He knew not
what to do, for to retreat was impossible.
</p>

<p>
Soon Rackley was over the underground
stream, and Lemuel Hankers and his son
followed.
</p>

<p>
All three ran after the young diver, who
retreated to the extreme rear of the cavern.
</p>

<p>
Here Rackley caught him by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"You had better submit quietly," said
Rackley.  "If you don't, it will be the worse
for you."
</p>

<p>
Dave saw at once that resistance was out
of the question.
</p>

<p>
They were three to one, and all armed,
while he was unarmed, and still weak from
his tumble and what had followed.
</p>

<p>
"You have no right to make me a prisoner,"
he remarked, for the want of something
better to say.
</p>

<p>
"We'll take the right," said Rackley, with
a wicked grin.  "Didn't expect to see me
here, after our little affair in the Washington
hotel, did you?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you'll get left now, as you did
then," retorted Dave.
</p>

<p>
Rackley produced a rope which he had
brought in with the tree limb, and soon
Dave's hands were bound behind him.
</p>

<p>
"I have an idea," said Lemuel Hankers.
"Why can't we leave him in this cave until
both ships have sailed?"
</p>

<p>
"Just my notion," answered Rackley.
</p>

<p>
"You can feed him until the <i>Raven</i> gets
back, and he will be kind of company for
you."
</p>

<p>
"I'll feed him if he behaves himself,"
growled Pete Rackley.
</p>

<p>
All three of the others tried their best to
"pump" Dave, but could get nothing out of
the young diver regarding his father's plans
or those of Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"You must find out yourself," he answered.
</p>

<p>
He was made to march to the extreme right
of the cave, and here Rackley fastened him
to a sharp rock which jutted from one of the
walls.
</p>

<p>
"There, I reckon he won't get loose from
that in a hurry," said the rascal, after his
job was finished.
</p>

<p>
Then the three evildoers withdrew to the
mouth of the cave, stopping at the
underground stream just long enough to remove
the tree limb so that Dave could not cross the
stream even if he did get free.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour later the others went
away from the cave, and all became as silent
as a tomb.
</p>

<p>
If the young diver had been disheartened
before, he was now utterly cast down.
</p>

<p>
He was a prisoner of the enemy, and he felt
almost certain that Pete Rackley would
desert him and leave him to starve.
</p>

<p>
No food had been left with him excepting
that which was in the water-soaked pouch that
he carried.
</p>

<p>
And this he could not get at, for his hands
were still bound tightly behind him.
</p>

<p>
An hour went by, and to him it seemed an age.
</p>

<p>
His thoughts wandered back to the
<i>Swallow</i>.  How was his stricken father getting
along, and what did he think of his disappearance?
</p>

<p>
And what had become of poor Bob Vilett,
who had accompanied him on this ill-fated
expedition after game?
</p>

<p>
"Captain Broadbeam will most likely send
out an expedition in search of us," he
reasoned, "but I don't think any of them will
come in here."
</p>

<p>
But then his hopes brightened a little.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps if the captain sent out somebody
to look for himself and Bob, that
person might discover the <i>Raven</i> in that
port.
</p>

<p>
"If the <i>Raven</i> is discovered, father will
feel sure Lemuel Hankers has had a hand in
my disappearance, and he'll take the rascal
to task for it."
</p>

<p>
Dave did not know that Lemuel Hankers
had given strict orders to Captain Nesik, of
the <i>Raven</i>, to keep out of sight of the
<i>Swallow</i>, and that the <i>Raven</i> was now well hidden
in a little cove thickly surrounded by palms
and tropical vines.
</p>

<p>
In less than two hours after leaving Dave,
Lemuel Hankers and his son rejoined the
<i>Raven</i>.
</p>

<p>
"What has become of Pete Rackley?"
questioned Captain Nesik.
</p>

<p>
"He went off by himself," answered
Lemuel Hankers.  "To my mind, he isn't just
right in his head."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"He ran around like a crazy man, and
broke out into the wildest kind of singing.
Said he was done with living on a ship, and
was going to become a hermit."
</p>

<p>
This story was told for the benefit of the
crew of the <i>Raven</i>.
</p>

<p>
In private, Lemuel Hankers told Captain
Nesik the truth, and before nightfall the
captain went ashore, pretending to look for
Rackley.
</p>

<p>
When he came back he announced that
Rackley must be dead, for he had found his
hat at the top of a high cliff overlooking the
ocean, and a part of his jacket on the jagged
rocks below.
</p>

<p>
That night the <i>Raven</i> pulled up anchor and
left the vicinity of the island.  Before
morning she was crowding on all steam, steering
straight for the spot where the sunken
treasure ship had gone down.
</p>

<p>
On board of the <i>Swallow</i> there was much
anxiety when Dave and the engineer did not
return.
</p>

<p>
Captain Broadbeam did not deem it advisable
to acquaint Amos Fearless with the true
state of affairs at once.
</p>

<p>
When the old diver asked where Dave was,
he was told that his son and Bob Vilett had
determined to stay out until the next day.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime poor Dave remained a
prisoner in the cave.  His wet clothing gave
him something of a chill during the night,
and morning found him sick and hungry, and
almost ready to give up in despair.
</p>

<p>
It was scarcely daylight when Dave heard
odd-sounding footsteps approaching from the
outer entrance of the cave.
</p>

<p>
He strained his eyes and at last made out
a large wild animal.
</p>

<p>
It was a savage-looking jaguar, and had
tracked the footsteps of those who had come
to the cave the day before.
</p>

<p>
Presently the jaguar came to the underground
stream.
</p>

<p>
Here it paused for a moment, then leaped
to the other side.
</p>

<p>
It was now less than fifty yards from where
Dave stood, a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the wild beast lifted its head,
stared into the darkness, and gave a growl of
rage.
</p>

<p>
It had discovered the helpless boy!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
WELL-TIMED SHOTS
</h3>

<p>
"I am lost now for sure!"
</p>

<p>
Such were the words which escaped Dave
Fearless' lips as he watched the approach of
the jaguar that had entered the cave and
leaped the underground stream.
</p>

<p>
The young diver had long since given up
trying to loosen the bonds which held him so
tightly to the jagged rocks.  Pete Rackley
had done his villainous work well, and the
efforts to get free had only caused the cords
to sink deeply into Dave's wrists and ankles,
until now the blood was flowing freely from
those members.
</p>

<p>
And it was this blood which the wild beast
of the island forest had scented!
</p>

<p>
The growl of the jaguar echoed and
re-echoed throughout the lonely cave, causing
Dave to shiver as with the ague.
</p>

<p>
It did indeed look as if the young diver's
last hour on earth had come.
</p>

<p>
"Hi, go away!" he cried, frantically.
"Go away!  Scat!"
</p>

<p>
The cries caused the jaguar to pause while
yet fifty feet from the youth.
</p>

<p>
It had never before attacked a human
being, and the new experience caused it to
proceed with caution.
</p>

<p>
But now it advanced again, crouching low
on the cavern floor, its two eyes glowing like
balls of fire in the semi-darkness of the retreat.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer came the beast, until
Dave imagined he could feel the hot breath
of the jaguar upon his cheek.  Then the tail
of the animal began to oscillate slowly,
showing that the jaguar was preparing to make a
leap.
</p>

<p>
Bang! bang!
</p>

<p>
Almost deafening was the double report of
a repeating rifle as it rang throughout the
cave.  At the shots the jaguar leaped high
in the air, turned over several times, and then
stretched itself in a convulsive death shudder.
</p>

<p>
Dave could scarcely believe his eyes and
ears.  Who had thus unexpectedly come to his
deliverance?
</p>

<p>
"Bob!"  The cry was little short of a
scream.  "Where in the world did you come
from?"
</p>

<p>
"From the bowels of the earth, I reckon,"
was the reply, as the young engineer of the
<i>Swallow</i> ran forward.  "Is the beast dead?"
he went on, as he halted at the outer edge of
the underground stream.
</p>

<p>
"I guess he is," answered Dave, watching
the jaguar for a moment.  "You are a good
shot."
</p>

<p>
"I knew I had to kill him, or it would be
all up with you, Dave.  But how came you
to be bound to yonder rock?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a long story.  Take care of that
stream, or you'll go underground again.
You'll have to get a tree limb, or something,
before you can come over.  I think
you'll find a tree limb at the mouth of the
cave."
</p>

<p>
Without delay Bob Vilett ran out of the
cave again, to return in a few minutes with
the very tree limb Pete Rackley had used for
crossing the stream.
</p>

<p>
Soon the young engineer was at Dave's
side, and a slash or two of a pocket-knife set
the young diver free.
</p>

<p>
Then both lost no time in quitting the cave.
</p>

<p>
Sitting down near the entrance, each told
his story, to which the other listened with
close attention.
</p>

<p>
Bob Vilett had lost his senses after going
down into the hole, and had recovered, to find
himself resting on a ledge in another cave,
not far from the one Dave was occupying.
</p>

<p>
In trying to get out he had lost his way,
and had at last emerged in the middle of a
tiny valley choked with brush, vines, and
other tropical growth.
</p>

<p>
He had wandered around until chance had
brought him to the cave where Dave was a
prisoner, and he had been astonished beyond
measure to hear his friend calling loudly.
</p>

<p>
"It was a lucky thing that I retained my
rifle, and that the water didn't hurt the
cartridges," concluded Bob.  "Had it been
otherwise, the jig would have been up with
you."
</p>

<p>
"That's true, Bob, and I shan't forget
what you have done for me," returned Dave,
warmly.
</p>

<p>
"Where have the rascals gone?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Probably they have carried
out the plot they mentioned while here."
</p>

<p>
"Then the <i>Raven</i> has sailed."
</p>

<p>
"But what of the <i>Swallow</i>?  Surely they
wouldn't sail without us."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think they would.  We must hunt
her up without delay."
</p>

<p>
"I must have something to eat first.  I am
as hungry as&mdash;as that jaguar was."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  I have it.  Let's broil ourselves
a jaguar steak, just for the novelty."
</p>

<p>
To this Dave instantly agreed, and returning
to the cave, they brought the beast forth
and Bob proceeded to cut him up.
</p>

<p>
The steak was soon broiling over a fire
which Dave kindled, and the smell proved
more than appetizing.
</p>

<p>
The jaguar meat was tough and not of an
extra fine flavor, yet they were tremendously
hungry, and that made them less critical than
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
In less than an hour the dinner was over,
and after getting a drink and a wash-up, both
proceeded on their way.
</p>

<p>
It was warm outside of the cave, so they
did not suffer much inconvenience because of
their wet clothing.
</p>

<p>
"Now to find our way back to the <i>Swallow</i>,
and with all speed," said Dave.  "Which
do you suppose is the right direction?"
</p>

<p>
"That way," and Bob pointed with his hand.
</p>

<p>
"And I was thinking it was in that
direction," and Dave pointed at right angles to
the other course.
</p>

<p>
Then both laughed.
</p>

<p>
"We can't both be right," said Bob.
</p>

<p>
"Let us split the difference and take a
course between the two.  Then we probably
won't go far wrong, Bob."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are."
</p>

<p>
On they went, into the valley which Bob
had traversed, and then up the line of hills
where they had shot the goats just after
coming ashore.
</p>

<p>
But now they found themselves confronted
by a deep ravine, partly choked with brush
and vines.
</p>

<p>
"How are we going to get across that, Dave!"
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to walk along the bank until
we reach some crossing-place," answered the
young diver.  "I am not going to risk a
tumble by taking a leap."
</p>

<p>
"Nor I.  I have had tumbles enough to
last me a lifetime," and the young engineer
shook his head dubiously.
</p>

<p>
On they went, the way growing more perilous
every moment.  They were at the edge
of a forest, and the top of the ravine was
lined with loose rocks.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Bob, having made a leap from
one rock to another, went down in a heap and
gave a loud cry of pain.
</p>

<p>
"My foot!  My foot!"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"I've caught my foot under the rock!"
</p>

<p>
Dave immediately hastened forward, and
saw that his chum was indeed fast.
</p>

<p>
The foot was wedged in a crevice, and could
not be budged until Dave rolled the rock
away by main force.
</p>

<p>
Then Bob grated his teeth and gave a deep
groan.
</p>

<p>
"My ankle!  It must be broken!  Oh, Dave!"
</p>

<p>
And with another moan he fell back in a faint.
</p>

<p>
If Dave had been alarmed before, he was
doubly so now, and he scarcely knew what to
do.  He remembered passing a pool of water
a distance back, and he ran to this, filling the
water bottle Bob had been carrying.
</p>

<p>
The water revived the young engineer
somewhat, and in the meantime Dave cut
loose his shoe.  He found the injured ankle
much discolored, and swelling rapidly.  He
bathed it, and this gave some relief, until the
pain gave way to a stiff numbness.
</p>

<p>
"Now I am in a pickle," groaned Bob.
"Did ever anybody run up against such luck
before?"
</p>

<p>
"Better not try to stand yet," replied
Dave.
</p>

<p>
"Stand?  Why, the pain would go to my
very heart if I tried it!"  And poor Bob gave
another groan.
</p>

<p>
Dave walked back and got more water, and
after another bath the sprained ankle was
bound up in some crushed leaves and some
linen torn from one of the youth's shirtsleeves.
Then they made themselves as comfortable
as possible on the rocks, and began
to talk over the new turn of affairs.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I had better go on alone?"
questioned Dave.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Somehow, I don't think
we ought to separate."
</p>

<p>
"I agree, and yet we ought to try to reach
the <i>Swallow</i> as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
"That's so, too."
</p>

<p>
"Supposing I try to get over the ravine
and to the top of the hill?  I won't get out
of rifle shot, and it may be I'll be able to spot
our ship from the hilltop."
</p>

<p>
"All right, go ahead.  But don't wander
too far, or&mdash;gracious, look!"
</p>

<p>
He broke off short and pointed to a tree
growing close at hand.
</p>

<p>
The leaves of the tree had parted slowly,
and now from between them appeared the
hideous head and shoulders of a monstrous
gorilla!  The gorilla's eyes were bent upon
both boys, and the beast looked as if he meant
immediate mischief!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
SURROUNDED BY SAVAGES
</h3>

<p>
"He's coming down on us, Bob!"
</p>

<p>
"Jump and save yourself, Dave!"
</p>

<p>
Crack! bang!
</p>

<p>
The cries and shots were uttered almost at
the same time, and the air was instantly filled
with smoke, followed by an unearthly squeal
from the gorilla, who instantly disappeared
from view.
</p>

<p>
But the beast was not seriously wounded,
for the rifle balls had merely nipped his paw
and his shoulder, and he was in a terrible
rage.
</p>

<p>
"Is he dead, Bob?"
</p>

<p>
"Beckon not, for I can hear him climbing
through the tree."
</p>

<p>
"We ought to get away from here, for
there may be more of the gorillas about."
</p>

<p>
"That's true.  But I can't walk."
</p>

<p>
"I'll carry you."
</p>

<p>
And having allowed Bob to slip some extra
cartridges into the repeating rifle, Dave took
his friend up in his arms.
</p>

<p>
He was just about to start down the ravine
when the gorilla showed himself a second
time.
</p>

<p>
He had armed himself with half-green
cocoanuts, and taking aim, he let fly at Dave's
head.
</p>

<p>
"Dodge!" yelled Bob, and the cry came
none too soon, for the missile brushed over
the top of the young diver's head.  Then
came several more cocoanuts, and Bob was
struck in the side.
</p>

<p>
He could not stand the fusillade, and
watching his chance, discharged the rifle
again.
</p>

<p>
He only fired one shot, but this found its
way through the gorilla's stomach, and
mortally wounded the creature.
</p>

<p>
Down dropped the cocoanuts, one at a time.
Then the animal's hold relaxed, and he
too came down, almost at the feet of the
youths.
</p>

<p>
The distorted, half-human face was terrible
to look upon, and both Dave and Bob turned
quickly away.
</p>

<p>
"I never want to see another gorilla,"
shuddered Dave.
</p>

<p>
"And I never want to shoot one," responded Bob.
</p>

<p>
Along the ravine went the young diver,
carrying his friend upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Two hundred feet of the rough way was
covered when they reached a spot where the
ravine might be crossed with ease.
</p>

<p>
Over they went, and then Dave set down
his burden and took a well-earned rest.
</p>

<p>
By this time night was coming on, and still
they were at least half a mile from the sea-coast.
</p>

<p>
"We won't gain the <i>Swallow</i> to-day,"
murmured the young diver, ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"And perhaps we won't gain the ship at
all," responded the young engineer.
</p>

<p>
As is usual in the tropics, night came on
suddenly.  The sun went down behind the
trees and the rim of the distant ocean, and
soon the stars shone out clearly and beautifully.
</p>

<p>
All was quiet save for the sounds of the
night birds in the thicket behind them.
</p>

<p>
To keep off the wild animals they built a
large camp fire, and at this cooked some of
the meat they had brought along from the
cave.
</p>

<p>
Bob's ankle was cared for several times
during the evening, and the youth declared
that it now felt much better.
</p>

<p>
They took turns watching during the night,
yet little came to disturb them.  Once Dave
heard a wild animal approaching and brought
up the rifle, ready to fire on the instant.  But
the fire made the beast keep his distance, and
he finally slunk away without showing himself.
</p>

<p>
Both boys were up at daybreak, and Bob
declared that he would try to walk upon his
foot, at least as far as the seacoast.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour's climb took them to
the top of the hills, and here they took a good
look at the beach and the ocean spread out
before them.
</p>

<p>
Not a sign of the <i>Swallow</i> was to be seen
anywhere.
</p>

<p>
This was disheartening, and Dave's heart
sank.
</p>

<p>
Were they really deserted?
</p>

<p>
"We can't see all of the beach from here,"
said Bob, encouragingly.  "See, yonder
patch of wood hides a good stretch from view.
The <i>Swallow</i> may be behind that.  And even
if she has gone off, remember that Pete Rackley
was to disable her so that she would have
to put back for repairs."
</p>

<p>
"And so far as he was concerned, I might
have starved in the meantime," added Dave,
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He must be a thorough rascal."
</p>

<p>
"He is.  But no worse than Lemuel
Hankers, to my way of thinking, Bob."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are."
</p>

<p>
They had to be careful in descending the
side of the hill, for here were many treacherous
stones, and neither wished to risk another
sprained ankle.
</p>

<p>
But at last they stood at the bottom, with
the ocean's shore but half a dozen rods away.
</p>

<p>
The foam from the breakers could be seen
distinctly through the tall palms, and with
their hearts beating rapidly they hurried
forward to where a long stretch of dazzling sand
stood as a barrier between the woodland and
the water.
</p>

<p>
"No ship here," said Dave, soberly.
</p>

<p>
"This is not the spot where the <i>Swallow</i>
cast anchor, Dave.  The question is, was that
cove north or south of here?"
</p>

<p>
"North, I should say."
</p>

<p>
"This time I agree with you.  Come, walking
along the beach will be easy enough."
</p>

<p>
And so it proved, although the fierce rays
of the sun soon made both more than willing
to seek the shade of the overhanging palms
and other tropical trees which lined the beach.
</p>

<p>
At a distance ahead the beach curved, and
as they approached this spot they heard a
sudden wild shouting, combined with a flapping,
which was altogether new to their ears.
</p>

<p>
"Savages, I'll bet a dollar!" cried Bob.
"We had better go into hiding!"
</p>

<p>
"But what is that other noise?" queried Dave.
</p>

<p>
"I can't imagine.  But come, don't stay here."
</p>

<p>
Both started for the forest, but the
movement came too late.
</p>

<p>
From around the curve of the beach
appeared half a dozen wild savages of the South
Sea type, and the two youths were discovered.
</p>

<p>
"Hi ki werra!" shouted one of the savages.
He was armed with a bow and arrows,
and quickly leveled an arrow at Dave, who
was nearest.
</p>

<p>
"Hi ki werra!" repeated the other savages,
and they, too, leveled their arrows.
"The white demons!  The white demons!"
</p>

<p>
"We are in for it now!" whispered Dave.
"Give them a shot from the rifle!"
</p>

<p>
"No, that would only make them mad,"
replied the young engineer.  Nevertheless, he
pointed the rifle at the head of the nearest
native.
</p>

<p>
The effect was magical, for the savage
immediately threw up both hands and began to
yell like a madman.
</p>

<p>
He had once seen a gun go off and a goat
shot thereby, and he imagined the "white
demon" was going to slay him likewise.
</p>

<p>
The other savages also came to a halt, and
all lowered their arrows.
</p>

<p>
Then Bob lowered the rifle.
</p>

<p>
A long pause on both sides followed.
</p>

<p>
The natives did not know what to do, and
the youths were in a similar predicament.
</p>

<p>
One of the savages began to jabber away
in his native tongue, but neither Dave nor
Bob understood a word of what was said.
</p>

<p>
"This is all Greek to me!" shouted Dave.
"Talk English."
</p>

<p>
"Englees!" repeated the savage, and
shook his head.  He understood that single
word, but no more.
</p>

<p>
"We want to be left alone," put in Bob.
"If you don't leave us alone, somebody will
get hurt."
</p>

<p>
"Englees," repeated the native.  Then,
struck by a sudden inspiration, he advanced
a few feet, threw down his bow and arrows,
and held out his hands.
</p>

<p>
"He wants to be friendly, evidently," observed Bob.
</p>

<p>
"If it isn't a trick," answered the young
diver.  "I must say I don't like their looks."
</p>

<p>
"No more do I; but what are we to do, retreat?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather than fall into the hands of cannibals
I'd go back over the hills to the cave."
</p>

<p>
The native was coming closer, and he tried
to put as pleasant a look on his face as possible.
</p>

<p>
But the effort was a failure, for he was
both crafty and cruel, and this disposition
shone in every line of his reddish-black features.
</p>

<p>
"Go back!" shouted Bob, and raised the
rifle again.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had he spoken when there came a
shout from the rear, and looking behind them,
the two youths found that they were surrounded!

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
ANOTHER CAPTURE
</h3>

<p>
"We are in for it now, Dave!"
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, Bob.  What shall we do,
fight?"
</p>

<p>
"It would be useless, for they outnumber
us ten to one."
</p>

<p>
And so speaking, Bob lowered the rifle once
more.
</p>

<p>
It was well he did so, otherwise several
arrows would have been sent whizzing
through his body.
</p>

<p>
In a few seconds the natives had closed in
on them and taken the rifle and other things
from them.
</p>

<p>
Then they were bound with thongs and
carted up the beach.
</p>

<p>
During all this time the thrashing on the
beach ahead had continued, and now the boys
saw what caused it.
</p>

<p>
In some unaccountable manner a whale had
become cast up by the breakers.
</p>

<p>
He was caught in some brushwood and a
fallen tree, but was doing his best to get back
into his native element.
</p>

<p>
The savages considered the whale a great
find, and were doing all in their power to
make him their prisoner and kill him.
</p>

<p>
Scores of arrows had been shot into the
huge, blubbery body, and the beach was dyed
crimson with the blood of the marine monster.
</p>

<p>
Yet he thrashed around lively, and one
native who went too near was knocked
senseless by a blow from the whale's tail.
</p>

<p>
The fighting with arrows went on for a
quarter of an hour longer, and in the meantime
a long rope, made of vines and as tough
as rawhide, was passed around the monster
and made fast to a tree back of the beach.
</p>

<p>
The whale fought to the last, but gradually
its struggles grew less and less, and finally
ceased altogether.
</p>

<p>
Then arose a loud shouting, and rushing
in, the savages began to dig at the body with
their long knives and their war hatchets.
</p>

<p>
Some of the blubber they ate raw, much to
the disgust of the prisoners, who found
themselves forced to look on.
</p>

<p>
"They are worse than Esquimaux,"
muttered Dave.  "Ugh! it makes me sick at the
stomach."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what they intend to do with us?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no telling.  But I guess they
won't eat us so long as the whale meat lasts.
They seem to relish that immensely."
</p>

<p>
The boys passed a dismal half-hour, and
during that time the savages cut up the whale
and carted the meat off in huge chunks.
</p>

<p>
Then a savage who was evidently a chief
came up and ordered some of his followers to
bring Dave and Bob along.
</p>

<p>
Still bound, the two chums were picked up
by two savages, who seemed to count their
weight as nothing.
</p>

<p>
A journey lasting over an hour followed,
straight into the interior of the island.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the inland lake previously
mentioned, the band of savages halted.
</p>

<p>
Bob and Dave were tied fast to two trees,
and then the natives proceeded to hold a
council of war.
</p>

<p>
They wished to question the lads, but not
one of them could speak English.
</p>

<p>
Presently a loud chanting was heard, and
from a distance the boys saw more savages
approaching.
</p>

<p>
There were three men and half a dozen
women.
</p>

<p>
There was likewise another man, but he
was white, even though his face had evidently
been stained a reddish-brown color.
</p>

<p>
This man wore an attire which was comical
in the extreme.
</p>

<p>
The suit consisted of a sailor's shirt and
trousers, the latter cut off at the knees, and
a shiny stovepipe hat, the band filled with
feathers.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" burst from Dave.  "Look
at that scarecrow!"
</p>

<p>
As soon as the man in the silk hat appeared
all of the natives began bowing and chanting
in chorus, and this they kept up until the
strange one lifted his hands and let out a
peculiar yell.
</p>

<p>
Then the stranger caught sight of the boys
and ran up to them.
</p>

<p>
"Be th' eyes av Saint Patrick!" he cried,
in a rich Irish brogue.  "Who are ye, now;
tell me that!"
</p>

<p>
"An Irishman!" ejaculated Dave, fervently.
"Thank Heaven, one man can talk
United States."
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" demanded Bob.
</p>

<p>
At this the Irishman took off the stovepipe,
swung it into the air, and made them a
profound bow.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, I am Pat Stoodles, grand muck-a-muck
av this wild tribe av haythins, castaway
sailor from th' bark <i>Emma D.</i>, high lord av
the island, and second cousin av the royal
Emperor of Turkey, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
And he laughed long and loud, and then
shook hands.
</p>

<p>
"Are you putting this on for the natives'
benefit?" questioned Bob.  "If you are, let
me say they don't understand a word."
</p>

<p>
At once a frown crossed Pat Stoodles' face.
</p>

<p>
He was indeed a castaway, and a solitary
life of several years had partly turned his
brain.
</p>

<p>
When the savages had found him he had
acted so strangely that they had fancied he
was some inhabitant of the infernal region.
At first they had wanted nothing to do with
him, but they had ended by making him something
of a chief.  In their own language they
called him the fun-making high lord.
</p>

<p>
Pat Stoodles listened to their talk with
interest, but shook his head when they
mentioned the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You are afther bein' mistaken about th'
ship," he said.  "No ship comes here.  What
looks loike a ship is a vision in th' heavens,
nothin' more!"  And he clenched his fists.
He had looked so long for a sail when alone
that the subject had turned his brain.
</p>

<p>
"Poor chap!" said Bob, in an undertone,
"I don't believe he can help us much."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he can save our lives."  Our
hero turned to the Irishman.  "What will
these natives do with us?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure an' I don't know.  Maybe they'll
be afther makin' princes av ye, me bould
b'ys!"
</p>

<p>
"We would like our liberty."
</p>

<p>
Pat Stoodles shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Ye can gain yer liberty on but wan night
av the month," he said.  "That is whin th'
moon is full an' they be afther havin' the
feast av the skulls."
</p>

<p>
They did not know if he was in earnest, or
if the talk was that of a crazy man.
</p>

<p>
Having spoken with them for some time,
Pat Stoodles turned to the natives and began
to jabber at them.
</p>

<p>
Evidently he had learned much of their
language, for they listened attentively.
</p>

<p>
Then they brought the boys something to
eat and to drink, and tried to make them
otherwise comfortable.
</p>

<p>
But they would allow neither of them his
liberty.
</p>

<p>
Night came and went, and still the chums
remained prisoners of the savages.
</p>

<p>
Pat Stoodles spoke to them a long while in
the morning, and at last appeared to believe
their story of a ship.
</p>

<p>
"I will be afther lookin' fer her," he said.
"But it's more likely a drame.  I used to be
afther dramin' loike that meself."  And then
he disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The morning slipped by, and the boys were
thoroughly miserable.  At first the natives
left them alone, but presently they came on
one after another and pulled their noses, their
ears, and their hair.  One savage doused them
with dirty water from the lake, and all
laughed loudly at the trick.
</p>

<p>
Noon had come and gone, when of a sudden
several shots sounded in the distance.
</p>

<p>
The shots were followed by a loud yelling
of natives, and at once those surrounding
Dave and Bob ran off to learn the cause of
the conflict.
</p>

<p>
"Something is up!" cried Dave.  "What
can it mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I reckon we'll soon learn," answered the
young engineer.
</p>

<p>
A few more shots followed, and soon after
all became quiet, the stillness lasting for over
an hour.
</p>

<p>
Then a chanting was heard, and a body of
savages appeared, having in their midst two
prisoners.
</p>

<p>
"Look!" cried Dave.  "Captain Broadbeam
and Doctor Barrell!  Is it possible!"
</p>

<p>
He was right.  The newly made prisoners
were the captain and the doctor, who had been
surprised while on a second hunt for the
missing ones.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
A DOOR OF WATER
</h3>

<p>
"Dave Fearless!  And Bob Vilett!  Thank
Heaven you are not dead!"
</p>

<p>
So spoke Captain Broadbeam as his eyes
rested upon the two youthful prisoners of
the savages.
</p>

<p>
The captain's clothing was torn, and there
were marks of blood upon his face, showing
that he had not submitted without a struggle.
Indeed, both the captain of the <i>Swallow</i> and
Doctor Barrell had fought to the bitter end.
</p>

<p>
"We have been hunting everywhere for
you," put in the doctor.  "Some thought you
dead, but we were not willing to believe it."
</p>

<p>
"Did a man named Pete Rackley come to
the <i>Swallow</i>?" questioned Dave, quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of a man of that name,"
answered the captain, "but there came to us
a poor and forlorn castaway, who said he had
been alone on this island for nearly two
years."
</p>

<p>
"Please describe him," said Bob.
</p>

<p>
The captain did so.  Both Dave and Bob
gave a groan.
</p>

<p>
"He is a fraud!" burst out the young diver.
</p>

<p>
"And he will wreck the <i>Swallow</i> before
we can get back to her," added Bob.
</p>

<p>
Of course, both Captain Broadbeam and
Doctor Barrell were astonished at these remarks.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," said the master of
the ship.
</p>

<p>
As quickly as he could Dave explained the
plot which had been hatched out by Lemuel
Hankers and which Rackley, his tool, was to
carry out.
</p>

<p>
"It is dastardly!" cried both the captain
and the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"And to think I took him on board, gave
him new clothing, and promised him pay until
we should get back to the States," added the
captain.
</p>

<p>
"Even now he may be wrecking my beautiful
engine!" groaned Bob.  "Oh, if only
I had the rascal by the neck!"
</p>

<p>
The savages now interrupted the talk by
separating the prisoners, tying each to a tree
some distance from the others.
</p>

<p>
Pat Stoodles was nowhere to be seen, for
he had gone off in an entirely different
direction from that taken by the natives.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the day dragged by until night was
at hand.  The natives were busy preparing
the meat taken from the whale, and for the
time being paid but scant attention to the
prisoners.
</p>

<p>
"We must escape to-night," thought Dave.
</p>

<p>
Yet how was it to be accomplished?
</p>

<p>
Although the natives took little notice of
them, one of the younger men of the tribe
had been set on guard, to see that none of
them broke his bonds.
</p>

<p>
At last darkness settled down on the
encampment.  At first the fire blazed brightly,
but at last it died down, leaving the prisoners
in gloom.
</p>

<p>
The savages gathered close to the campfire,
the women by themselves, and were soon
wrapped in slumber.
</p>

<p>
One native remained on guard, seated on a
fallen tree.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a form appeared in the midst of
the prisoners.
</p>

<p>
It was Pat Stoodles, but so transformed
that Dave scarcely recognized the half-witted
Irish castaway.
</p>

<p>
Stoodles was dressed in a suit of skins, and
on his head rested a crown made of horn, set
with peacock feathers.
</p>

<p>
In his hand the Irishman carried a long knife.
</p>

<p>
"I am the King of the Island Windjammers!"
he cried, in a low tone.  "I am sent
to free the world!  Avaunt, ye ghosts of
ships!  Begone, ye rats of my brain!
Ha! and how is that, my bonnie b'y!  An' that!
An' that!"
</p>

<p>
Rambling on in this fashion, he quickly cut
the ropes which held Dave and Bob.  Then
he turned to Captain Broadbeam and of a
sudden he stopped with mouth wide open.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Broadbeam, or is it another av
thim drames?" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Pat Stoodles!" cried the captain.  "And
so you are the king of these savages.  Release
me at once!"
</p>

<p>
"I will!  I will!" answered Stoodles, and
cut the bonds, and also those of the doctor.
</p>

<p>
All this time the savage on guard was looking
on in silence, for he dared not interfere
with the doings of Stoodles.  Yet he grew
uneasy when he saw all the prisoners
liberated and saw the Irishman shake Captain
Broadbeam by the hand.  He gave a sudden
and shrill cry.
</p>

<p>
Quick as a flash Stoodles turned upon him.
</p>

<p>
"That's fer ye!" roared the Irishman, and
knocked him flat with a blow of his fist.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, we must get away!" cried Dave.
"See, all of the savages are awake!"
</p>

<p>
He spoke the truth, and the others felt that
they must fly on the instant or it would be too
late.
</p>

<p>
"To the woods!" cried the doctor.  "Perhaps
we can hide!"
</p>

<p>
"I will show ye a spot!" put in Stoodles.
"I have a cave all me own where they won't
be afther findin' ye!"
</p>

<p>
He led the way and the others followed,
through the brush and up a hill back of the
lake upon which the encampment was located.
</p>

<p>
It was a crooked and dangerous path, yet
by keeping close to Stoodles they avoided
many a nasty pitfall.
</p>

<p>
Soon they heard the savages on their trail.
At first they were some distance off, but
gradually they grew closer and closer.
</p>

<p>
"I can't go much further!" gasped poor
Bob.  "My ankle pains me something
awful!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't ye be afther givin' up!" said Pat
Stoodles.  "We'll soon be at me castle, which
all the savages on the island can't conquer."
</p>

<p>
They were now passing along the bed of a
small stream which flowed into the lake.
Presently before them arose a beautiful
waterfall, twenty feet high and eight or nine
feet broad.
</p>

<p>
"That's the dure av me castle,"
announced Stoodles.  "Make a quick sthep
inside an' ye'll not git overly wet."
</p>

<p>
With this he dove straight into the
waterfall and disappeared from view.
</p>

<p>
"Gracious!  What does that mean?" came
from Dave.
</p>

<p>
"He is mad and has committed suicide,"
muttered the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not," came from Bob.  "That
waterfall may conceal the entrance to a
cave."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  I believe you are right,"
answered Dave.  "And I am for finding out,"
and he took a step forward.
</p>

<p>
But the captain caught the young diver by
the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be rash, lad.  It may cost you your
life."
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had Captain Broadbeam spoken
when Stoodles reappeared through the
falling sheet of water.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!" he cried.  "Don't be afraid.
The futtin' is safe enough," and again he
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
None of the others hesitated any longer.
Dave went first, holding his breath as he took
the plunge.  To his surprise the falling body
of water was less than four inches thick, and
in a moment he found himself on a smooth,
rocky floor.
</p>

<p>
"That's the greatest yet!" muttered Bob,
when all were safe in the cave under the
upper stream.  "Don't the savages know of
this?" he asked of the Irishman.
</p>

<p>
"Sure not.  Once they followed me up the
strame an' I scared the wits out av thim,
talkin' to thim from the wathers!"  And
Pat Stoodles laughed loudly, a laugh that
echoed and re-echoed throughout the cavern.
</p>

<p>
It was pitch-dark, but soon they had a light,
and Stoodles brought forth a torch.
</p>

<p>
Then he led the way to a branch of the
cave, on higher ground.
</p>

<p>
Here the flooring and walls were perfectly
dry, and here the castaway had something of
a comfortable home, with a rude table, a
bench, a sea chest, and a cupboard with dishes
and other household articles.
</p>

<p>
In one corner of the cave was a rough
fireplace, the smoke of a fire going up through
half a dozen small cracks.
</p>

<p>
It was easy to see that the castaway had
not always been simple-minded.
</p>

<p>
"I knew him years ago quite well," said
Captain Broadbeam.  "He once sailed under
me.  He is suffering for the want of
companionship.  Many a castaway, you know,
has gone stark mad through loneliness.  The
savages were really no company for him."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he will get over it?" asked
Dave.
</p>

<p>
"I think he will," put in the doctor.  "I
have seen such cases before.  Sometimes the
recovery is quite rapid, when the castaway
gets back among his own people."
</p>

<p>
Leaving the crowd seated around a comfortable
fire, in order to dry their clothing
before going to sleep, Pat Stoodles returned
to the entrance of the cave.
</p>

<p>
He was gone the best part of half an hour,
when he returned in considerable excitement.
</p>

<p>
"The haythins have tracked us to the
waterfall!" he whispered.  "An' wan av
thim&mdash;Chief Walru&mdash;is thinkin' av thryin'
to git behind th' water into the cave!"

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
THE ESCAPE TO THE COAST
</h3>

<p>
The announcement that the savages were
trying to get into the cave under the waterfall
filled Dave and his friends with new alarm.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure of this, Stoodles?" questioned
Captain Broadbeam, as he leaped to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"I am," was the Irishman's answer.
</p>

<p>
"We ought to be able to hold them back,"
put in the doctor.  "Can't we hurl them into
the stream as fast as they appear?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the talk," came from Bob.  "Let
us line up just this side of the waterfall."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we can scare them," suggested
Dave.  "I know all savages are very
superstitious."
</p>

<p>
All made their way to the edge of the
waterfall, and Pat Stoodles showed them a
crack in the rocks, at the side of the falls.
</p>

<p>
Here they could see the savages lined up
outside, with Chief Walru at their head.
</p>

<p>
Several were talking excitedly, and the
chief was wading in the water at the very
foot of the falls.
</p>

<p>
Now the chief took up a rock and hurled it
into the waterfall.
</p>

<p>
It whizzed past Doctor Barrell and struck
the flooring some distance to the rear of the
cave.
</p>

<p>
Dave saw the movement, and of a sudden
a strange idea came into his head.
</p>

<p>
He would scare the savages if he could.
</p>

<p>
Filling his lungs with air, he let out a most
blood-curdling scream, followed by a series
of wild and unearthly groans and a long
hiss.
</p>

<p>
The savages were thunderstruck, and those
on the bank of the stream took to their heels
with all possible speed, while Chief Walru
tumbled backward and then began to scramble
over the rocks for dear life.
</p>

<p>
Again Dave let out a scream, and then
groans which were more dreadful than the
others.
</p>

<p>
In less than three minutes not a savage was
to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"They have gone!" said Bob.
</p>

<p>
"If only they don't come back," returned
Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"I have an idea," said the young diver.
"Why can't we pile up some stones in front
of that opening?  Then if the savages try to
get through the waterfall they will get badly
left."
</p>

<p>
"That's the talk!" came from Bob.  "Are
there stones handy, Stoodles?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, plinty of thim."
</p>

<p>
And the Irishman showed the way to where
lay a quantity of stones, large and small.
</p>

<p>
With the doctor holding a torch to light
them, all hands began to haul stones to the
opening.  Those that were flat were placed on
the bottom and soon the opening was filled up
to within two feet of the top.  Other stones
were piled up behind, so that those in front
might not be shoved back.
</p>

<p>
"Now we are safe&mdash;at least for the time
being," said Captain Broadbeam.  "But the
next question is, how are we to escape and get
on board of the <i>Swallow</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't there another exit from the cave?"
asked the doctor.
</p>

<p>
Pat Stoodles shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"If there is, I never was afther findin'
wan," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
All were utterly worn out by their adventures
and by the work on the stone wall, and
glad enough to rest.
</p>

<p>
Yet each took his turn at a two hours'
watch, so that they might not be surprised.
</p>

<p>
But the savages did not come back during
the night, nor did they see anything of the
natives during the morning.
</p>

<p>
Pat Stoodles had provisions stored in the
cave and they made a hearty breakfast, after
which all felt decidedly better.
</p>

<p>
From the Irishman, who seemed to be
growing clearer in his mind every hour, they
learned that they were about half a mile from
the seacoast.
</p>

<p>
The way to the shore lay through a thick
jungle, with here and there a treacherous
swamp.
</p>

<p>
With extreme caution they left the cave and
started up the stream and into the jungle.
</p>

<p>
They were constantly on the lookout for the
savages, but a quarter of a mile was covered
and not a native showed himself.
</p>

<p>
"Dave scared them for fair," said Bob.
"Perhaps they have left the island altogether."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afther foolin' yerself,"
answered Pat Stoodles.  "Thim haythins is
wust whin they are sthill."
</p>

<p>
In this remark the Irishman was correct,
for hardly had he spoken when an arrow
whizzed through the air and pierced Doctor
Barrell's hat.
</p>

<p>
"They are after us!" cried several in
chorus.
</p>

<p>
"We must run fer it!" came from Stoodles.
"Folly me, an' be amazin' quick about
it, too," and away he leaped at top speed.
</p>

<p>
Nobody needed a second warning, and all
kept as close to the Irishman's heels as
possible.  He led them into a thicket of vines and
underwood.  In the meantime several more
arrows came flying through the air, and Dave
was struck in the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I am hit!" he murmured, and stopped short.
</p>

<p>
"Is it bad?" asked Captain Broadbeam,
who was close to him.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I guess not.  But it doesn't feel very
good," and the young diver gave a gasp for
breath.
</p>

<p>
As quickly as he could the captain
extracted the arrow, and when they were in the
thicket the wound was bound up.  It was not
serious, but it gave Dave a stiff side for
several days afterward.
</p>

<p>
Once the thicket was gained, Pat Stoodles
did not halt, but led the way deeper and
deeper into the jungle.  Some rocks were
passed and then they came out on what looked
like the edge of a moss-covered opening.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" yelled the Irishman at Bob, who
was going ahead.  "Stop, if ye value yer loife!"
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong now?" asked the young
engineer.
</p>

<p>
"That spot is afther bein' worse nor the
bogs av ould Ireland," explained Pat Stoodles.
"It's as sticky as glue.  Perhaps we
can lead the savages into it."
</p>

<p>
He led the way around the opening and all
followed, pausing on the opposite side.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the body of natives appeared,
and, seeing the whites, broke into a
triumphant yell.
</p>

<p>
A shower of arrows were sent forth, but
the whites ran for the shelter of the nearest
trees and nobody was struck.
</p>

<p>
Then out into the opening rushed the savages,
still yelling and brandishing their bows
and arrows.
</p>

<p>
But they did not go far.
</p>

<p>
Less than a rod of the opening was passed
when they began to sink into the black ooze
beneath the green moss.
</p>

<p>
They tried to turn back, but it was in vain.
</p>

<p>
From their ankles they sank to their knees,
and then to their waists.
</p>

<p>
Their war cries changed to shrieks of alarm
and then to frantic appeals to their comrades
to help them.
</p>

<p>
Over a dozen were caught in the glue-like
bog, and every one of the number was in danger
of losing his life.
</p>

<p>
The whites were totally forgotten, and the
others, coming up, turned their whole attention
to rescuing those in such dire peril.
</p>

<p>
Pat Stoodles laughed loud and long over
the success of his ruse.
</p>

<p>
"Now it's good-by to ye!" he cried, shaking
his fist at the natives.  "I'm no more the
grand muck-a-muck, but a dacent Irish sailor
come back to his siven senses."
</p>

<p>
Again he led the way through the jungle,
striking out directly for the ocean shore.
</p>

<p>
To force their way through the tropical
growth was not easy, and made every one of
the party pant for breath.
</p>

<p>
They stirred up many tropical birds and
once came upon a colony of monkeys, who
fled, shrieking and chattering, in all directions.
</p>

<p>
At last they could plainly hear the booming
of the surf.
</p>

<p>
"The ocean!" cried Dave.
</p>

<p>
"If only we come in sight of the <i>Swallow</i>!"
put in Bob.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we had better be careful before
we show ourselves," remarked Captain,
Broadbeam.  "There may be natives on the
beach."
</p>

<p>
The matter was talked over, and it was
decided that Stoodles and the captain should go
forward to investigate.
</p>

<p>
The pair were gone less than ten minutes
when Captain Broadbeam came running back
in excitement.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Swallow</i> is not in sight," he said.
"But another ship is."
</p>

<p>
"Another ship?" queried Dave, and then
seeing a queer look on the captain's face, he
added: "You don't mean the <i>Raven</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do mean the <i>Raven</i>!" was the
answer, which filled the others with dismay.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
A DASH FOR A ROWBOAT
</h3>

<p>
The <i>Raven</i> and not the <i>Swallow</i> was in
sight!
</p>

<p>
The several members of the party looked
at each other questioningly.
</p>

<p>
What was to be done now?
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I'm not going to ask Lemuel
Hankers for help," said Dave, decidedly.
"I'd rather put up with the savages."
</p>

<p>
"No! no!  That would be foolish," put in
Doctor Barrell.  "Why, if those natives got
hold of us now they would kill us on the spot."
</p>

<p>
"An' be afther eatin' ye in the bargain,"
added Pat Stoodles.
</p>

<p>
"But to go aboard the enemy's ship!"
protested the young diver.
</p>

<p>
"They wouldn't dare to kill us," said Captain
Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"They will have to transfer us to our own
vessel," said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
While they were discussing the situation,
Stoodles went back to learn what the savages
were doing.
</p>

<p>
Presently he ran up with the information
that the natives had divided into two parties,
one to help those in the morass and the other
to continue the pursuit of the whites.
</p>

<p>
"An' the second party is afther comin' up
fast," he concluded.  "Ye must run fer it or
invite capture."
</p>

<p>
"Come, we will join the <i>Raven</i> and trust
to luck," said Captain Broadbeam.  And so
it was decided, although against Dave's
wishes.
</p>

<p>
Soon they were out on the beach and running
for the cove where the <i>Raven</i> lay at anchor.
</p>

<p>
The ship had gone into hiding to escape being
discovered by those on board the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
Lemuel Hankers felt certain that Pete
Rackley would so disable Captain Broadbeam's
craft that the <i>Swallow</i> would never
reach the spot where the sunken treasure lay,
at the bottom of the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Lemuel Hankers was on deck with his son
when the party came into sight of the ship.
</p>

<p>
He gazed intently at the group of running
persons who were waving their hands,
frantically, toward the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Give me a glass!" he cried, quickly.
</p>

<p>
The powerful marine glass belonging to
Captain Nesik was handed to him.
</p>

<p>
He gave one look, then muttered an imprecation
not to be placed upon these pages.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?" questioned Bart.
</p>

<p>
"Dave Fearless, Captain Broadbeam and
some others, probably men from the <i>Swallow</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"What!" ejaculated the youth.  "And
look, they act as if they wanted to board our
ship!"
</p>

<p>
"They must have learned of Pete Rackley's
doings!" burst from Lemuel Hankers' lips,
and his face grew deadly pale.
</p>

<p>
"Then our jig is up, dad."
</p>

<p>
"They wish to make trouble!" groaned
the rich man.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't let them on board," put in
Bart, quickly.  "Let us pretend not to see
them and sail away."
</p>

<p>
"We'll do it," answered the father.
</p>

<p>
He ran to where Captain Nesik stood, and
gave the necessary order.
</p>

<p>
The anchor was hove apeak in double-quick
order, and the command was passed to the
engine room to back the <i>Raven</i>, full speed.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for the evildoers, steam was
up, and in less than half a minute the <i>Raven</i>
had left the cove and was moving swiftly out
into the Pacific Ocean.
</p>

<p>
Those on shore could scarcely believe their
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"She is sailing away!" burst from Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"They do not intend to take us on board!"
put in Doctor Barrell.
</p>

<p>
"But do they know who we are?" questioned Bob.
</p>

<p>
"They must know," said Dave.  "Remember,
they have powerful glasses on board.
Perhaps they spotted us as soon as we came
into sight."
</p>

<p>
"It would please them, I suppose, to have
the savages kill us," went on the captain.  "I
wouldn't have believed it before, but I do
now&mdash;since you have told me what this Pete
Rackley was to do."
</p>

<p>
In bitter disappointment the crowd ran
down to the very edge of the cove, Pat
Stoodles at their heels.
</p>

<p>
They saw a number of persons standing on
the stern deck of the <i>Raven</i>, but could
distinguish no faces.
</p>

<p>
In less than half an hour the ship was far
out to sea.
</p>

<p>
While the party on the beach was watching
the receding ship, Stoodles uttered a cry.
</p>

<p>
"The savages.  They be afther coming on
again, bad cess to 'em!"
</p>

<p>
The Irishman was right.  The savages had
found their trail and were once again after
them hot-footed.
</p>

<p>
Which way now?  That was the question in
the mind of every member of the party.
</p>

<p>
It was Dave who solved the problem.  Gazing
across the cove, he espied a good-sized
rowboat half hidden among some bushes.
</p>

<p>
The boat had been left there by those on
the <i>Raven</i> the night before, and in the
excitement of the departure had been completely
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
"A boat!  A boat!" he cried.  "Come!"
</p>

<p>
He led the way on a run, with the others
close upon his heels.
</p>

<p>
But to circle the cove, which was surrounded
with tropical trees, vines, and sharp
rocks, was not easy; and before half the
distance was covered they heard the cries of the
savages.
</p>

<p>
"They are coming closer!" came from
Bob.  "Perhaps we had better hide again."
</p>

<p>
"Don't ye be afther doin' such a foolish
thing," answered Pat Stoodles.  "They kin
track ye quicker nor an Indian could do th'
thrick.  Take to the boat&mdash;it's safer."
</p>

<p>
On they went, over the rocks and through
the tangle of undergrowth.  Often one or
another would stumble, and scratches and rent
clothing were numerous.  Closer and closer
came the natives.  When the latter saw how
fresh the trail was they let out a blood-curdling
cry of triumph.
</p>

<p>
At last our friends were within a hundred
yards of the boat.  But now poor Bob was
exhausted, for his foot still pained him greatly.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I can't run any&mdash;any more!" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll carry you," answered Captain
Broadbeam, and caught the young engineer
up in his arms.
</p>

<p>
At last the rowboat was gained and they
were delighted to note that it contained two
pairs of stout oars.  Into the craft they
tumbled as rapidly as possible, and it was Dave
who helped Captain Broadbeam to shove off.
</p>

<p>
The movement came none too soon, for
scarcely were all but poor Bob seated at the
oars than the natives burst into view through
the jungle back of the stretch of beach
surrounding the cove.
</p>

<p>
"Hi gi!  We-ra!" they yelled, and then a
shower of arrows was aimed at our friends.
One arrow cut through the captain's coat and
another buried itself in the stern of the
rowboat.
</p>

<p>
"Pull!  Pull!" shouted Dave.
</p>

<p>
And then they all pulled as never before,
Captain Broadbeam giving the stroke, and
soon the rowboat was carried a hundred feet
from shore.  But now came a second flight of
arrows and Pat Stoodles was hit in the back.
</p>

<p>
"I'm done fer!" he moaned, and fell in a
heap at the bottom of the craft.
</p>

<p>
"Give me his oar!" came from Bob, and
with his teeth set grimly, he caught up the
drifting blade and took his place among the
rowers.
</p>

<p>
Shower after shower of arrows now flew
all around the rowboat and its occupants and
nearly all on board were struck, although none
seriously, for the distance was now too great
for the savages' aim.
</p>

<p>
"Keep it up&mdash;we'll soon be out of range,"
panted Captain Broadbeam, and straight out
into the broad Pacific plunged the rowboat,
over the breakers and then into the mighty
swells beyond.
</p>

<p>
At last the cove began to fade from view
and the arrows no more reached them.
</p>

<p>
""We are saved!" murmured Bob, and
then fell unconscious beside Pat Stoodles.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Dave to continue rowing, that the
boat might not be upset by the long ocean
swells, Captain Broadbeam and Doctor Barrell
turned their attention to Bob and to Pat
Stoodles.
</p>

<p>
It was found that Bob was suffering from
a wound in the shoulder, and the loss of blood,
following his former weakness, had been too
much for him.
</p>

<p>
"He'll be all right after a while," said the
doctor, after binding up the wound.  "That
is, unless there was poison on the arrow tip,
and I see no evidence of such poison in the
appearance of any of our wounds."
</p>

<p>
Poor Pat Stoodles was worse off and it was
a grave question whether he would live or die.
</p>

<p>
He did not regain consciousness, although
the doctor did his best for the poor Irishman.
</p>

<p>
"He needs stimulants," said Doctor Barrell.
</p>

<p>
"And we haven't so much as a drink
of water," answered Captain Broadbeam,
soberly.
</p>

<p>
An hour went by and the hot sun poured
down fiercely upon those in the rowboat.
</p>

<p>
They knew not which way to turn, fearing
that if they attempted to land again the
savages would follow them up.
</p>

<p>
"We will row in the direction of the landing
place where we first came ashore," said
Captain Broadbeam, and this was done.
</p>

<p>
An hour later Dave let out a cry of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"The savages!  They are after us again!"
</p>

<p>
He was right.  Around a distant point of
land had appeared at least a dozen savages,
and all were making for the rowboat with all
speed!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
ON THE BOSOM OF THE OCEAN
</h3>

<p>
"We can't land here!" cried Dave.
</p>

<p>
"You are right," answered Captain
Broadbeam.  "See, more savages are coming
from behind yonder trees."
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" questioned the doctor,
his face full of concern.
</p>

<p>
"There is but one thing to do&mdash;put to sea
again," came from the master of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
The savages came on with a rush, yelling
at the top of their lungs.  As they approached
the water's edge they let fly a shower of arrows.
But fortunately for our friends, all fell
short of the mark.
</p>

<p>
As quickly as it could be accomplished, the
rowboat was turned around and headed once
more from the island.  All who had been
rowing were tired, but did their best to get the
craft away from the shore.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the savages saw the boat leaving
they set up another yell, and several rushed
away to find those who were out in the
canoes.
</p>

<p>
But the latter were on the other side of the
island, and before they could be notified our
friends had, for the time being, made good
their escape.
</p>

<p>
Dave was all but exhausted, and at last
dropped his oar and sank in a heap on the
seat.
</p>

<p>
"Played out, eh?" came from Captain
Broadbeam.  "Well, I don't wonder.  I'm
about played out myself."
</p>

<p>
An hour went by and the rowboat rose and
fell on the broad swells of the Pacific Ocean.
</p>

<p>
In vain they looked in all directions for the
<i>Swallow</i>.  The vessel was not to be seen.
</p>

<p>
All in the rowboat were exceedingly thirsty
and would have given much for a drink of
water.
</p>

<p>
Crouched on the seats, with poor Bob and
Pat Stoodles beside them, Dave, the captain,
and the doctor talked the situation over.
</p>

<p>
"We are certainly in a pickle," said Dave.
"If we can't find the ship, what then?"
</p>

<p>
"We must find the <i>Swallow</i>," declared
Captain Broadbeam.  "Unless we do, we'll
starve to death."
</p>

<p>
"We might return to the island at nightfall,"
said the doctor.  "Remember, we need
water and so do these poor sufferers."  And
he pointed to Bob and the Irishman.
</p>

<p>
"That's a scheme," cried Dave.  "We
might land under cover of darkness and hide
somewhere until we can locate the ship."
</p>

<p>
Slowly the day wore away.  Towards nightfall
the wind began to blow strongly, sending
the spray flying in all directions.
</p>

<p>
"We can't stand this," was Dave's comment.
"If it blows any harder, we'll be
swamped."
</p>

<p>
"We must take to the oars and keep the
boat up to the seas," said the captain, and
this was done.
</p>

<p>
A little later it began to rain.  At first it
did not amount to much, but presently it
began to pour.  As best they could, they
gathered a small quantity of the water and drank
it greedily.  They also gave Bob and Stoodles
a drink, which did the injured much good.
</p>

<p>
At last night was upon them, black and
threatening.  The rowboat was drifting in the
wind and the rain, but where to none could
tell.
</p>

<p>
"We must take what comes," said Captain
Broadbeam, gravely.  "We are in the hands
of Providence."
</p>

<p>
Dave was so exhausted he could not keep his
eyes open and soon he went sound asleep, and
not long after this the doctor followed his
example.  Only the captain remained awake
and he was so exhausted he could do
absolutely nothing.
</p>

<p>
It was about three o'clock in the morning
when the wind began to blow a regular hurricane.
The mad plunging and pitching of the
rowboat aroused Dave.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"The storm is increasing," answered the
captain.
</p>

<p>
"Are we still out on the ocean!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Captain Broadbeam had scarcely spoken
when there came a shock that almost turned
the rowboat over.
</p>

<p>
"We have struck!"
</p>

<p>
"We are going to the bottom!"
</p>

<p>
The shock aroused all but Pat Stoodles.
Bob would have gone overboard had it not
been for Dave, who caught the unconscious
man by the shoulder and held him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't&mdash;don't hurt me!" groaned Bob.  "Oh!"
</p>

<p>
A moment later came another shock.  Then
the rowboat appeared to slide over a sand bar,
and of a sudden Captain Broadbeam felt the
limb of a tree brush his side.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo! what's this?" he ejaculated.  "A
tree limb&mdash;and here's another!  Can it be a
floating tree&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  Here's land!" burst out Dave,
peering into the darkness.  "A shore of some
kind."
</p>

<p>
"Beware of the savages," cautioned Doctor
Barrell.  "They may be close at hand."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather meet the savages than drown
in this storm," came bluntly from Captain
Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
The rowboat had indeed drifted to some
sort of a shore.  Close at hand was a sandy
beach, and beside this some rocks and a grove
of tropical trees.  The details of the scene
were lost in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
As the rowboat struck on the beach the captain
leaped out and hauled the craft up.  But
he was not quick enough to escape the
breakers and one swept over the craft, nearly
drowning all on board.  Then Dave sprang
out, and at last the pair had the boat out of
the reach of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven we have landed somewhere,"
declared the youth.  "I thought sure
we were bound for Davy Jones's locker."
</p>

<p>
The rowboat was dragged along the beach
and the captain, the doctor, and Dave
succeeded in turning it over on some rocks, thus
making of it a sort of shelter from the storm.
Under it they placed Bob and the Irishman,
making them as comfortable as circumstances
permitted.  This done, the three found
something of a shelter under the trees and there
sank down to rest until morning.
</p>

<p>
When Dave opened his eyes the sun was
shining brightly and close at hand a number
of tropical birds were singing gayly.  For
the moment he could not remember what had
occurred and he sat up, gazing around in
bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"We are shipwrecked," he murmured at
length.  "I wonder if those savages are
anywhere near?"
</p>

<p>
He arose and stretched himself and then
walked out on the shore of the island.  None
of the others were awake, and he determined
to let them rest as long as they wished,
providing no danger was at hand.
</p>

<p>
Not a soul was in sight and the place looked
much different from that where the savages
had been encountered.
</p>

<p>
"It looks to me as if this is another
island," he reasoned, and he was right.
</p>

<p>
On the shore were a number of oysters and
clams, and he lost no time in picking up as
many as he thought they might use for a meal.
Then he caught up several stones and sticks
and went after the birds.  He was good at
throwing and soon brought down three birds
of fair size.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, what's doing?" was the cry, and
he saw Captain Broadbeam approaching.
</p>

<p>
"I'm trying to gather something for breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Good enough.  Seen anything of the savages?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"This doesn't look like the same island."
</p>

<p>
"Just what I think, captain."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope there are no savages here.
Seen anything of the <i>Swallow</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing whatever."
</p>

<p>
Some brushwood and sticks were gathered,
and after a little trouble a fire was started.
The smell of the cooking clams and oysters
aroused the others.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! a fire and breakfast!" cried the
doctor.  "That interests me!"
</p>

<p>
"How do you feel, Bob?" questioned Dave,
bending over his friend.
</p>

<p>
"Tired all over, Dave.  Where are we!"
</p>

<p>
"On one of these islands of the ocean."
</p>

<p>
"Have we escaped from the savages?"
</p>

<p>
"For the present, yes."
</p>

<p>
"I'm mighty hungry."
</p>

<p>
"You shall have breakfast as soon as it is
cooked."
</p>

<p>
"Sure an' I'm hungry meself," came from
Pat Stoodles.
</p>

<p>
"How are you feeling?" questioned the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Loike I had been through a clothes
wringer, docthor," was the answer.  "Bad
cess to thim savages!"
</p>

<p>
Not long after this the clams and oysters,
as well as the birds, were ready for eating,
and Bob and the Irishman were given what
the doctor thought was best for them.  The
others ate their fill, and after the repast was
over all felt much better.
</p>

<p>
"There are just two things for us to do,"
said Captain Broadbeam: "Keep out of the
way of the savages and find the <i>Swallow</i>."
</p>

<p>
"And in the meantime we have got to feed
ourselves and take care of the wounded,"
added Doctor Barrell.
</p>

<p>
The matter was talked over and it was
decided that the doctor should remain with Bob
and Stoodles, while the captain and Dave went
on a short tour of exploration.
</p>

<p>
"I do not imagine that this island is very
large," said the captain, as he and Dave set
out.  "To my mind it won't be a bad idea
to skirt the shore first."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you say," answered the youth.
</p>

<p>
"We want to keep our eyes peeled for the
savages, though."
</p>

<p>
It was an easy matter to follow the shore
on two sides of the island, but to the north
and the west were numerous rocks, and they
climbed over these only with the greatest
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful, or you'll sprain an ankle,"
said the captain.
</p>

<p>
"There seems to be a hill near the center
of the island," said the young diver.
"Wouldn't it be a good idea to climb to the
top of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as soon as we have finished skirting
the shore."
</p>

<p>
Presently they came to a spot where some
extra high rocks hid what was beyond from
their view.
</p>

<p>
"Hark!" cried Dave, coming to a sudden
halt.  "What was that?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," answered the captain.
"Sounded like somebody calling, didn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Both listened, and presently from the other
side of the rocks came a low whine, followed
by a scream.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody is there!" murmured Dave.
"Perhaps a savage!"
</p>

<p>
"We'll take a peep," began Captain Broadbeam,
when of a sudden a hairy form leaped
on top of the rocks and confronted them.
</p>

<p>
The form was that of a gorilla.  The creature
was all of four feet high, with strong
limbs and a face of peculiar ferocity.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" yelled Dave.  "He means mischief!"
</p>

<p>
The young diver was right.  The gorilla
gave a snarl, and the next instant made a leap
for Captain Broadbeam's shoulder.  It landed
fairly and squarely on the captain and bore
that individual to the ground.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
FIGHTING A GORILLA
</h3>

<p>
The appearance of the gorilla had been so
unexpected that for the instant Dave knew
not what to do.  As the captain went down
with the creature on top of him, the young
diver fancied that the man would surely be
killed.
</p>

<p>
"Help!" cried Captain Broadbeam, and
this call aroused the youth to his senses.
Catching up a stick, he hit the gorilla a
resounding whack on the head.  Then he struck
at the beast's body.
</p>

<p>
The gorilla did not like such treatment, and
with a snarl it dropped its hold on the
captain and turned towards Dave.  A moment
later it was on the young diver's breast and
Dave was doing his utmost to throw the
creature off.
</p>

<p>
It was now the young diver's turn to call
for assistance, which he did most lustily.
</p>

<p>
"I'll help you!" cried the captain, and
catching up a stone, he hit the gorilla in the
side with it.  The creature gave a snarl and
sprang back to the top of the rocks.  Then it
disappeared as suddenly as it had come.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!" murmured Dave.  "What a horrid beast!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"Only a scratch or two."
</p>

<p>
"We were lucky to get off so easily, lad."
</p>

<p>
"Is he gone for good!" asked Dave, with
a slight shiver.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know."
</p>

<p>
Each now lost no time in arming himself
with a stout club and with a couple of
fair-sized and sharp stones.  They listened, but
could hear nothing of the gorilla.
</p>

<p>
"I'd feel safer if I knew that beast was
dead," said the captain.  "He may take it
into his head to attack us again."
</p>

<p>
"And he may be only one of a regular
tribe," put in Dave.
</p>

<p>
"No, Dave; gorillas don't live together
like monkeys.  At the most you'll find two
together."
</p>

<p>
With great caution they climbed to the top
of the rocks and peered over.  Not a living
creature of any sort was in sight.
</p>

<p>
"He has gone, that's certain," said Dave,
and gave a sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
They went on their way, and inside of an
hour had walked completely around the island,
which was not over half a mile in diameter.
</p>

<p>
"Now we'll go up the hill and take a look
around," said Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
On the side of the hill the tropical growth
was thick, and they had to fairly cut their way
through the tangle of underbrush and long
trailing vines.
</p>

<p>
"This is what I call work," said Dave,
panting.  "How much further have we to go?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very much further, Dave.  I
think&mdash;listen!"  The captain broke off short and
both listened.  But only the murmur of the
breeze through the trees came to their ears.
</p>

<p>
"What did you hear?" asked the young diver.
</p>

<p>
"I fancied I heard that gorilla again."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't say that!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I was mistaken.  But it would
be just like the beast to follow us," continued
the master of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
"We will have to be on our guard."
</p>

<p>
Both looked around with care, but could see
nothing of the gorilla.  Then they pushed on
once more, up the rocks and through a tangle
of vines until they reached a bit of a clearing
on the very top of the hill.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are, safe and sound!" said the
captain.  "I wish we had a spyglass."
</p>

<p>
They took a careful look around, and noted
that the island was circular in form, with a
small cove on the south shore, where the
rowboat had landed.
</p>

<p>
On all sides stretched the rolling Pacific,
the waves glistening brightly in the strong
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Not another island of any sort was in sight.
</p>

<p>
"I believe that other island is to the
westward of this," said the captain.  "But it's
too far off to be located with the naked eye."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see anything of the <i>Swallow</i>, or
of any other ship," came from Dave, after he
had gazed around for several minutes.
</p>

<p>
"The ship is probably in the vicinity of
that other island."
</p>

<p>
From the top of the hill they could see that
the island was uninhabited.  Whether or not
any wild beasts outside of the gorilla were
located there they could not determine.
</p>

<p>
"I hope we don't have to stay here too
long," remarked the young diver, as they
started back for the spot where they had left
Bob and Stoodles.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to stay until we find the ship."
</p>

<p>
Halfway down the side of the hill Captain
Broadbeam gave a sudden leap into the air.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" he screamed.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" queried Dave.
</p>

<p>
"Spiders!  As big as your hand!"
</p>

<p>
The master of the <i>Swallow</i> was right.  He
had stepped on a mound which was a spiders'
nest, and out from the soil issued ten or a
dozen big brown and yellow spiders, most
ferocious in their appearance.
</p>

<p>
The creatures made after both the captain
and Dave, and both lost no time in putting a
good distance between themselves and that
vicinity.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh!  I never saw such spiders in my
life!" gasped Dave, when he thought himself
safe.
</p>

<p>
"They certainly were large, Dave.  But
such things grow big in the tropics."
</p>

<p>
"They looked as if they might be poisonous."
</p>

<p>
"They are.  We must watch out for them
in the future."
</p>

<p>
Not long after this they came to a spot
where a number of bushes were growing,
covered with large, oval-shaped berries.
</p>

<p>
"These berries are perfectly good and very
nourishing," said the captain.  "Let us pick
a quantity and take them back to the camp."
</p>

<p>
Back of the patch of berries was a fine
spring and here they procured a cold drink
of water.  Just below the spring was a wide
pool several feet deep, and in this pool
numerous small lizards were darting around.
</p>

<p>
"Everything is full of life in the tropics,"
remarked the young diver.  "Just look at the
birds and fish, and lizards and spiders, and a
hundred and one other things!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and the vegetation is very plentiful,"
added the captain.
</p>

<p>
They were still some distance from the
shore when Dave called a halt.
</p>

<p>
"Look at the big birds yonder," he whispered.
"Can't we bring down two or three
with sticks or stones?  They will make fine
eating."
</p>

<p>
"We can try it, Dave."
</p>

<p>
Sticks and stones were handy, and arming
themselves they approached a large tree upon
which the birds were resting.
</p>

<p>
"Ready?" asked Dave.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Throw!"
</p>

<p>
The youth let fly a short stick and the captain
a sharp stone.  Down came two birds, one
dead and the other seriously wounded.  The
others set up a wild squawking and flew away.
</p>

<p>
"Not so bad!" cried the captain, and ran
to dispatch the wounded bird.
</p>

<p>
As he stooped over the bird there was a
strange cry from another tree close by and
then a whir through the air.
</p>

<p>
"The gorilla!" ejaculated Dave.  "Look out!"
</p>

<p>
The young diver's cry came too late.  Down
came the beast that had attacked them before,
landing directly on Captain Broadbeam's
shoulder and clutching the man by the throat!
</p>

<p>
For the instant Dave was almost paralyzed.
But then he realized the captain's peril and
rushed in to the man's assistance.
</p>

<p>
In his hands the young diver clutched a
heavy stick, and this he brought down with
all force on the gorilla's head.
</p>

<p>
The creature was taken by surprise and
dropped its hold.  But its skull was too thick
to mind greatly the blow which had been
delivered, and an instant later it leaped forward
once more, this time for Dave.
</p>

<p>
The young diver dodged, and in a twinkling
the gorilla had Dave around the waist while
the youth had the creature around the shoulder
and neck.  Then began the struggle, the
beast trying to bite and Dave trying his best
to prevent such a movement.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of the melee Captain Broadbeam
rushed to the rescue.  He had picked up
Dave's stick, which the young diver had
dropped, and now he struck the gorilla twice
across the back and then across the lower
limbs.
</p>

<p>
Not knowing what to make of this last
attack, the creature turned once more and
dropped its hold of Dave.  But at another
blow from the stick it began to retreat, and
soon was lost to sight in the jungle on the
hillside.
</p>

<p>
"He has gone!" said the captain, breathing
heavily from his exertions.
</p>

<p>
"What a fighter he is!" gasped Dave.  He
had all he could do to catch his breath.
</p>

<p>
"I wish we had killed him, lad.  Then he
couldn't bother us again."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's too bad we didn't finish him.  He
will probably lay low for us now.  Maybe he'll
attack us while we sleep."
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to stand guard."
</p>

<p>
Making certain that the gorilla had really
left the vicinity, they continued the journey
to the shore, reaching the camp a little while
later.  They found Doctor Barrell waiting
impatiently for their return.  Both Bob and the
Irishman were sleeping soundly.
</p>

<p>
"And what did you discover?" asked the
man of science.
</p>

<p>
"Very little," answered the captain.  "But
we have had a couple of nasty fights."
</p>

<p>
"With the savages?"
</p>

<p>
"No, with a gorilla."
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible!  Did you kill the creature?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he got away."
</p>

<p>
"Too bad!  I would give much to catch a
gorilla alive.  We could add him to our collection."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, but no live gorilla in mine,"
came promptly from Dave.  "Give me a dead
one every time."
</p>

<p>
The doctor listened to their story with much
interest and was glad to see they had brought
some berries and the birds for a meal.
</p>

<p>
"I have found some herbs and plants and
given both of the sufferers medicine," said
he.  "I think Bob Vilett will recover rapidly,
but it will take time to bring Pat Stoodles
around."
</p>

<p>
It was now midday, and the sun was scorching.
This being so, all were content to rest in
the shade.  A fire was built, and over it the
birds and also some oysters were done to a
turn, and these, with the berries, made a good
meal for all.
</p>

<p>
During the afternoon Dave made himself
a good bow and also several arrows.  The
captain followed his example, and also cut
several good-sized clubs.
</p>

<p>
"We must arm ourselves as best we can,"
said Captain Broadbeam.  "If those savages
should happen to come this way we'll be at
their mercy."
</p>

<p>
It was almost sundown when Dave chanced
to go down to the ocean front once more.  He
looked out to sea and then gave a cry that
aroused all of the others.
</p>

<p>
"A ship!  A ship!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
AN ATTACK IN THE DARK
</h3>

<p>
Dave's cry brought Captain Broadbeam to
the shore in a hurry.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the ship?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"There!" and the young diver pointed
with his hand.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, lad.  But she is not headed
for this island."
</p>

<p>
"Can she be the <i>Swallow</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"I should say not."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe she is the <i>Raven</i>."
</p>

<p>
"It is possible, Dave.  But she is not
coming here, that is certain."
</p>

<p>
"Shall we set up a shout?"
</p>

<p>
"It will do no good.  They could not hear us."
</p>

<p>
"We might fly a signal of distress."
</p>

<p>
"It is too dark for that now."
</p>

<p>
Both watched the ship with interest.  The
captain was right, the vessel was not headed
for the island, and in a few minutes it passed
from view.
</p>

<p>
"If that was a friendly vessel, it's a chance
gone," was Dave's sober comment.
</p>

<p>
"True, but it cannot be helped."
</p>

<p>
As usual in the tropics, night came on
quickly.  There was no moon, but countless
stars shone from on high.  The birds ceased
their songs, and presently all was quiet.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose we may as well proceed to
make ourselves comfortable," said Dr. Barrell.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody has got to remain on guard,"
came from Dave, who was not inclined to
forget that the gorilla was still at large.
</p>

<p>
"We'll divide up the night into three
watches of three hours each," said the
captain.  "I can take one watch, Dave another,
and the doctor the third."
</p>

<p>
So it was arranged, and it fell to Dave to
go on guard first.
</p>

<p>
"That suits me," said the young diver.
"I hate to break in on my night's rest after
I have once retired."
</p>

<p>
A comfortable spot had been selected for
all hands.  It was located about two hundred
feet from the shore, where there was a series
of rocks and some trees.  The doctor had
fashioned some brushwood into a shack, and
gathered additional brushwood for bedding.
</p>

<p>
To keep himself awake Dave began to walk
around the camp, and also made several trips
down to the ocean front.  He carried his bow
and his arrows with him, to help guard
against any surprise.
</p>

<p>
On his second trip down to the shore he
noticed a strange fire a long distance off.
</p>

<p>
"That must be a camp-fire of some sort,"
he mused.  "Perhaps it is that of the savages
on that other island."
</p>

<p>
He watched the fire for a quarter of an hour
and gradually it died away, leaving the ocean
as dark as before.
</p>

<p>
It must be confessed that his day's tramping
had made Dave sleepy, and it was all he
could do to keep his eyes open.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be glad when it comes my turn to go
to bed," he thought.
</p>

<p>
The young diver had less than half an hour
to remain on guard when his attention was
attracted to a peculiar sound among the trees
close at hand.
</p>

<p>
He looked in the direction, and was horrified
to see two shining eyes glaring down at
him.
</p>

<p>
"A wild beast, sure," he reasoned.  "Wonder
if the thing wants to attack me?"
</p>

<p>
As quickly as he could, he got his bow into
position and adjusted one of the arrows to the
string.
</p>

<p>
The eyes were still turned upon him and
the sight was enough to make his blood run
cold.
</p>

<p>
"Here goes!" he muttered, and taking
careful aim, he let the arrow fly with all force.
</p>

<p>
His aim was true, and no sooner had the
arrow struck than there was an unearthly
shriek, and out of the tree dropped a large
dark object.  It flipped and flopped over the
ground, uttering snarl after snarl.
</p>

<p>
"What's the row?" cried Captain Broadbeam,
leaping to his feet and seizing a club.
</p>

<p>
"I've struck something!" answered Dave.
"Take care!"
</p>

<p>
"It's that gorilla!"
</p>

<p>
"So I see&mdash;now," said the young diver.
</p>

<p>
The creature was seriously but not mortally
wounded and continued to flop around, uttering
the most unearthly of shrieks and cries,
which awoke all of the others in the camp.
</p>

<p>
"In mercy's name what does this mean?"
demanded Doctor Barrell, nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Here is your gorilla, doctor!" sang out
Dave.  "Come and get him if you want him."
</p>

<p>
"Ugh! what a horrid creature.  Is&mdash;is he
dangerous still?"
</p>

<p>
"He will be if you get too close to him."
</p>

<p>
"Kill him!  kill him!" cried Bob.  "Don't
let him come this way!"
</p>

<p>
Watching his opportunity, Captain Broadbeam
let fly with his club, hitting the gorilla
in the neck.  Then Dave put another arrow
into the creature's body, and at last it gave
a shudder and a gasp and rolled over dead.
</p>

<p>
"Kilt, is it?" came weakly from Pat
Stoodles.  "Sure an' it's a good job done, so
it is!"
</p>

<p>
The camp-fire was stirred up and the captain
picked up a torch and walked over to the
gorilla.
</p>

<p>
"Dead as a stone," he announced, and then
Dave and the doctor approached.
</p>

<p>
"We can save the skin and the skull," said
Doctor Barrell.  "They, at least, can do us
no harm."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad he is dead," came from the captain.
"Dave, you gave him a good one in the
eye."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad I had the bow and arrow to do it
with," answered the young diver modestly.
</p>

<p>
After this Captain Broadbeam went on
guard, and, utterly exhausted, Dave lay down
and slept soundly until long after the sun
came up on the following morning.
</p>

<p>
"Now I feel like a new man," said the
young diver on arising.  "I can tell you a
sound sleep is a wonderful thing."
</p>

<p>
"The question is, what are we to do next?"
came from the doctor.  "We cannot remain
on this island forever."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we shall have to remain until
some ship takes us off," said Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"And in the meantime we have got to provide
for ourselves," put in Dave.  "And that
is not going to be so easy unless we live on
clams, oysters, fish, and berries."
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget the birds," said the captain.
</p>

<p>
Dave wanted to go fishing, and after a good
deal of trouble succeeded in making a hook of
a big pin Bob had been using in place of a
button on his jacket.  For bait he used a big
bug he found under a dead tree limb.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how this is going to work,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there is nothing like trying,"
answered the captain.  "I'll see what I can do
to bring down some more birds and find some
fruit."
</p>

<p>
Dave started to fish in the cove, and it was
not long before he got a bite and pulled in a
fish weighing a couple of pounds.  This
encouraged him, and inside of an hour he had
a mess of nine to his credit.
</p>

<p>
"We'll be able to get all the fish we want,
that is sure," he reasoned.  "Living on the
island wouldn't be half bad, if it wasn't that
those fellows on the <i>Raven</i> may sail away and
get at that treasure before we have a chance
to reach the spot."
</p>

<p>
Dave could not help thinking, too, of those
on the <i>Swallow</i>, and he wondered how his
father was faring.
</p>

<p>
Having caught all the fish he wished he was
presently joined by Captain Broadbeam, who
had brought down two more birds.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'll take a swim," said Dave.  "I
feel as if I needed the wash."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I'll sit on the shore and watch
you," replied the captain.
</p>

<p>
The young diver was soon in the water,
which felt cool and refreshing.  He loved to
sport around, and dove and swam about to his
heart's content.
</p>

<p>
"Better come in," he said to the master of
the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Not to-day, lad," came back the answer.
"How is the bottom where you are swimming?"
</p>

<p>
"Sandy, with a few shells," answered
Dave.  "Do you know what I am thinking?"
he went on.  "There may be pearls here."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to do some diving and take a
look around."
</p>

<p>
Dave was as good as his word and dove not
once but a dozen times.  He brought up a peck
of oysters, but none containing pearls.
</p>

<p>
"Must have been mistaken," he said.  "I'll
try it once again."
</p>

<p>
He made a beautiful dive and reached the
bottom with ease.
</p>

<p>
But scarcely had he put out his hand for an
oyster when he saw something that filled him
with alarm.
</p>

<p>
A long, dark object was moving along the
ocean bottom towards him.
</p>

<p>
At first he could not make out what it was,
but presently discovered that it was a slimy
water snake.  The reptile was all of ten feet
in length and five or six inches in thickness.
</p>

<p>
Dave had no wish to encounter such a
horrible-looking creature, and turning, he started
to swim to the surface.
</p>

<p>
The water snake came after him rapidly,
and just as he got his head above water Dave
felt something slippery curl itself around one
of his legs and start to draw him under.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
DAVE AND THE WATER SNAKE
</h3>

<p>
"Help me, Captain Broadbeam!"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Dave!"
</p>

<p>
"A water snake has me by the leg."
</p>

<p>
Before Dave could say more the water
snake began to pull so fiercely that the head
of the young diver was forced under the
water.
</p>

<p>
He struggled desperately, trying his best
to get away.
</p>

<p>
But now the reptile swung the fore part of
its body around and embraced Dave's other
leg, rendering the youth almost helpless.
</p>

<p>
The young diver kicked as hard as he could,
but the reptile only clung the closer.
</p>

<p>
Down went the youth, until he felt that he
must be drowned or strangled to death.
</p>

<p>
He was afraid to feel for the snake with
his hands for fear of losing control of those
members also.
</p>

<p>
With a wild effort he arose almost to the
surface, so that he could see above him.
</p>

<p>
Whizz!  It was a rope, thrown to him by
Captain Broadbeam.  It belonged to the
rowboat and the captain had been carrying it,
thinking it might be useful in one way or
another.
</p>

<p>
The end of the rope just failed to reach
Dave, but as soon as he saw it the young diver
did his best to get hold of the object.
</p>

<p>
His breath was fast leaving him when he
managed to clutch the rope with one hand.
Then he drew it towards him and caught it
with his other hand also.
</p>

<p>
Captain Broadbeam was watching anxiously,
and as soon as he felt the rope tighten
he began to haul in, slowly at first and then
with might and main.
</p>

<p>
Nearer to shore came Dave, dragging the
horrible water snake behind him.  In vain the
reptile tried to stay its progress.  Then it
thrashed around and caught Dave at the neck.
In self-defense the youth had to take one
hand and try to force the water snake away.
But this could not be done.
</p>

<p>
At last Dave could walk on the bottom, and
then he struggled into shore with all speed.
</p>

<p>
As he did this, Captain Broadbeam came
to his assistance, and clutched at the reptile.
But the water snake was out of its element
on land, and in a trice it loosened itself,
dropped back into the ocean, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Dave was so exhausted he pitched headlong
on the sand, where he lay, panting for breath.
</p>

<p>
"Did he sting you?" queried the captain,
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so," was the gasped-out
reply.  "But he came pretty close to drowning me!"
</p>

<p>
"I reckon you won't go bathing again, lad."
</p>

<p>
"Not for a million dollars!"
</p>

<p>
"That's the worst of bathing in unknown
waters.  You don't know what you are going
to run up against."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't imagine there were water snakes
here."
</p>

<p>
After resting awhile, Dave dressed himself,
and the pair went back to the camp.
</p>

<p>
Dave was delighted to note that Bob was
recovering rapidly and that Pat Stoodles was
also doing as well as could be expected.
</p>

<p>
"You want to be careful, Dave," said Bob.
"We can't afford to lose you."
</p>

<p>
"And I don't want to be lost," answered
the young diver, grimly.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen anything of the savages?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a sign."
</p>

<p>
"They must wonder what has become of us."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they think we escaped to the ship."
</p>

<p>
"If we only had!"
</p>

<p>
"That is so, Bob, but we have got to make
the best of it."
</p>

<p>
"And you can't see a sign of the ship anywhere?"
</p>

<p>
"Not the least bit of a sign."
</p>

<p>
"Too bad!" and the young engineer gave
a deep sigh.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the hours dragged by.  It was very
warm, but there were signs of a storm in the
air.
</p>

<p>
Dave set to work to gather some firewood,
thinking a good fire would serve to keep them
comfortable in case of a heavy rain.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't be surprised if we got a heavy
one, when it does come," remarked Captain
Broadbeam, as he gazed at the sky.
</p>

<p>
"Storms in the tropics are apt to prove
severe," said Doctor Barrell.
</p>

<p>
Having collected the firewood, Dave went
out with his bow and arrows to see if he could
bring down some more birds.
</p>

<p>
At first he moved but a short distance from
the camp, but presently he saw some extra
fine birds at a distance and followed them
toward the north shore of the island.
</p>

<p>
He had just brought down one bird and was
trying for a second when the storm broke and
the rain began to come down heavily.
</p>

<p>
"This is severe, and no mistake," he
murmured.  "Guess I'll have to find shelter
unless I want to get soaked."
</p>

<p>
Not far away were some tall rocks, backed
up by a clump of bushes and vines.
</p>

<p>
The young diver moved towards the rocks
on the run.  He was but a few feet away when
he saw an opening in front of him&mdash;a split in
the rocks of unknown depth.
</p>

<p>
He tried to step back to safety, but it was
too late.  His feet slipped and down he went
for several yards.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, this won't do!" he cried.  "I
don't want to get into another underground
cave!"
</p>

<p>
He tried to climb up the rocks, but again his
feet slipped and he went down a yard or two
more.  This time he struck a solid flooring
of rocks, so to descend further was
impossible.
</p>

<p>
"Thank fortune the hole isn't any deeper,"
he said half aloud.
</p>

<p>
The fall had shaken him up somewhat and
for the minute he remained where he was, trying
to get back his breath.
</p>

<p>
He noticed that the rocks around him were
all perfectly smooth, but did not realize what
this meant until he tried to crawl to the top of
the opening.
</p>

<p>
He could not get a hold anywhere, and as
often as he got up a foot or two, he slipped
back again.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this is provoking, to say the least,"
he muttered.  "How in the world am I to get
out of here?"
</p>

<p>
The rain was now pouring down steadily,
and in a very few minutes he was wet to the
skin.
</p>

<p>
"If I had a rope or a pole I might get out,"
he reasoned.  But he had absolutely nothing
with which to help himself.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour went by and then to
Dave's alarm he found the water pouring into
the hole steadily from a rivulet above.  Soon
the water was up to his ankles and it arose
steadily to his knees.
</p>

<p>
The storm was now on in all of its fury, and
in the forest he could hear the trees swaying
and snapping under the pressure of the high
wind that was blowing.
</p>

<p>
Again he made an effort to crawl out of the
opening.  But the rocks were now wet and
slippery and afforded no foothold whatever.
</p>

<p>
The wind was increasing steadily until it
blew a regular hurricane.  High overhead he
saw some branches of trees sailing through
the air.
</p>

<p>
"I hope those in camp are safe," he said
to himself.
</p>

<p>
A little later came an extra heavy blast of
wind.  There followed a great crashing, and
in an instant a big tree fell directly over the
opening, cutting off much of the light above.
</p>

<p>
One of the tree branches pressed down on
Dave's head, forcing him to a sitting position
in the hole.
</p>

<p>
"This is the worst yet!" he muttered,
after he realized that he was not harmed.
"Now I am a regular prisoner.  I can't move
that tree, that's sure!"
</p>

<p>
By the aid of the tree limb the young diver
crawled upward until he reached the trunk
across the opening.
</p>

<p>
The branches were so thick he had to
literally force his way along.
</p>

<p>
The opening was almost closed by the big
tree trunk, but to one side there were several
loose rocks, and after an effort he succeeded
in shoving them into the hole and thus making
a place through which he crawled, although
not without great difficulty.
</p>

<p>
He was now free once more, and despite the
fury of the elements set off for the camp with
all speed.
</p>

<p>
To travel was not easy, and often he had to
make a detour in order to avoid a fallen tree
or a deep pool of water.
</p>

<p>
He was still a short distance from camp
when there came another terrific whirl of
wind that sent tree limbs flying in all
directions.  One struck Dave on the shoulder and
hurled him flat.
</p>

<p>
"Phew! this is awful!" he muttered, and
then stopped short, as a cry from a distance
reached his ears.
</p>

<p>
"Help! help!" came in Doctor Barrell's
voice.  "Help, or I shall be killed!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
WHAT THE STORM BROUGHT
</h3>

<p>
As quickly as he could Dave picked himself
up once more and hurried into the camp.
</p>

<p>
Here he ran into Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, did you call?" asked the captain.
</p>

<p>
"No, it was Doctor Barrell," answered the
young diver.  "Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
For reply came another call from the scientific
man, and now they located him down near
the shore of the ocean.  He was lying on his
back, with a small tree pressing him down
into the sand.  The waves were sending their
spray flying over him.
</p>

<p>
It was but the work of a moment to lift the
tree.  While Captain Broadbeam did this,
Dave helped the doctor to crawl to a point of
safety.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh! what an experience!" muttered
Doctor Barrell, as he gave a shudder.
"Thank you for rescuing me."
</p>

<p>
"How did it happen, doctor?" questioned Dave.
</p>

<p>
"I came out to look for you.  Just as I
reached the spot the wind sent the tree down
and over me.  I am thankful that I was not
killed."
</p>

<p>
All hurried into camp, and here Dave told
his story.  Then they had to watch out,
fearful that the storm would do them further
injury.
</p>

<p>
But the wind went down as rapidly as it
had come up.  The rain, however, continued,
and did not cease until noon of the next day.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to encounter many such
storms," said Dave, when the sun shone once
more.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to put up with them, if you
remain in the tropics," answered Captain
Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
When Dave and the others went forth after
the storm they picked up a great number of
dead birds.  The ocean shore was strewn with
stranded fish.
</p>

<p>
"Here is eating enough for a month, if
only it would keep," said Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"I hope we don't have to stay here a
month," answered Dave.
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, lad.  But we must take
what comes."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think we'll have a spell of good
weather after such a storm as this?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Then I move we take to the boat and try
to find our ship.  We can take the dead birds,
fish, and some oysters, clams, berries, and
cocoanuts along for provisions.  And also some
bamboo sticks full of fresh water."
</p>

<p>
The idea appealed strongly to Captain
Broadbeam and also to Doctor Barrell.  Bob
and the Irishman were willing to do anything
that the others wished.
</p>

<p>
"Let us start out to-morrow," said the
captain, and after that no time was lost in
preparing for the expedition.
</p>

<p>
The rowboat was carefully overhauled, and
then loaded with the things that seemed
necessary to take along.  Water was to be had
in plenty, and they filled many big, hollow
bamboo stems with it, corking up the stems
until the water should be wanted.
</p>

<p>
"We must remember to keep the island in
view," said the captain.  "We may be glad
enough to return, in case we cannot locate the
<i>Swallow</i>."
</p>

<p>
At last came the time set for starting out,
and Bob and Pat Stoodles were helped into
the rowboat.  The others followed, and the
captain and Dave pushed away and took to
the oars of the craft.
</p>

<p>
"I trust we find the ship," sighed Bob.  In
his weakened condition he longed for the
comforts which had been denied to him while on
the island.
</p>

<p>
"So do I hope we find the <i>Swallow</i>," answered Dave.
</p>

<p>
"We must keep a close watch for those savages,"
came from Captain Broadbeam.  "I
shouldn't wish to fall into their hands again."
</p>

<p>
"Bad cess to thim!" cried Pat Stoodles.
"Niver do I want to set me eyes on thim
ag'in!"
</p>

<p>
The rowboat passed around one corner of
the island and all looked eagerly for some sign
of a sail.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing in sight," said Dave.
</p>

<p>
"I see something drifting upon the
waves," announced the doctor.
</p>

<p>
All looked in the direction which he pointed
out and saw a large mass of driftwood floating
toward them.
</p>

<p>
"That means a wreck of some sort," cried
the captain.  "Let us make an investigation."
</p>

<p>
The others were willing, and not long after
this they came up beside the wreckage, which
proved to be a spar with cordage and part of
a forecastle and rail.
</p>

<p>
"Can that wreckage be from the
<i>Swallow</i>?" asked Dave, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"It may be," answered the captain.  "Still,
I am not sure."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it is from the <i>Raven</i>," came
from Doctor Barrell.
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather it was from that vessel than
from our own," said the young diver, quickly.
"But it may be from the <i>Swallow</i>, and I'll
tell you why," he added, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you remember about Pete Rackley?
He may have disabled our ship."
</p>

<p>
"If he has done so he should be swung
from a yardarm," came from Captain
Broadbeam, hotly.
</p>

<p>
As they could make nothing of the wreckage
they allowed it to drift by and continued
their journey around another point of the
island.
</p>

<p>
Not to tire themselves, they took turns at
rowing.
</p>

<p>
Bob and Stoodles were made as comfortable
as possible on the seats, with palm
branches laid over them, to protect them from
the fierce rays of the sun.
</p>

<p>
Thus an hour passed and still nothing of
importance came to view.
</p>

<p>
They saw some more wreckage at a distance,
and rowing up to it, discovered several
empty chicken crates and an empty water
cask.
</p>

<p>
"These prove nothing," said the captain.
"The crates may have been thrown overboard
on purpose."
</p>

<p>
"It's queer, with so much wreckage
around, we don't sight some ship," said
Dave.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, lad, for that wreckage is
not water-soaked and old."
</p>

<p>
Before long they began to grow hungry,
and stopped their search long enough to get
a lunch of berries and cold fish, washed down
with water from one of the bamboo stems.
</p>

<p>
"This is a great way to carry water," was
Dave's comment.  "It keeps it very sweet."
</p>

<p>
"So it does, Dave," said the doctor.
"But the water is bound to evaporate very
rapidly."
</p>

<p>
The lunch over, they resumed their journey.
They had put far out to sea on one side
of the island.  Now they returned, to put out
on the opposite side.
</p>

<p>
They were within three hundred feet of the
island when Doctor Barrell set up a cry of
warning.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!  Do not land!"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, doctor?" came from
the captain.  "We were not going to land.
We are bound for the other side of the
island."
</p>

<p>
"I saw some persons moving behind yonder
bushes and rocks," went on the man of
science.
</p>

<p>
"Saw somebody?" ejaculated Dave.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"White men?"
</p>

<p>
"No, savages!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure of this?" demanded Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I think I am," stammered the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Where are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone now."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you were mistaken, doctor,"
said Dave.
</p>

<p>
"It is possible&mdash;but I do not think so."
</p>

<p>
The rowboat was allowed to drift, and all
gazed earnestly toward the island.  But not
a person of any sort appeared.
</p>

<p>
"This is mighty queer," was the captain's
comment.  "The savages couldn't have been
there when we left."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe they just arrived," said Dave.
</p>

<p>
"That is possible.  Still&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I may have been mistaken," said Doctor
Barrell.  "Remember, my eyesight is not
of the best."
</p>

<p>
"I wish we were sure of this," went on the
captain.  "If the savages are on the island
in force I don't know as we shall care to go
back, even if we don't locate the ship."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they are hiding, thinking that
we will return," said Dave.  "One thing is
sure, we have got to be careful of what we
do after this."
</p>

<p>
They talked the matter over for a few minutes
more and then resumed their journey to
the other side of the island.  They kept their
eyes toward the shore, but neither man nor
beast came to view.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he saw some gorillas," said Bob,
who had listened to the talk.  "They look
like savages from a distance."
</p>

<p>
"Well, a lot of gorillas would be as bad as
a band of savages," answered Dave.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the rowboat proceeded on its journey
until they rounded another point of the
island.  Then Dave set up a shout of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" questioned the captain and
the doctor quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Savages!  They are after us in their canoes!"
</p>

<p>
The young diver spoke the truth.  There,
at no great distance from the island shore,
were two long war canoes, each filled with
the enemy.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the savages discovered the
whites they set up a mad yell of delight, and
then hurried in pursuit of our friends.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
ON THE SHIP ONCE MORE
</h3>

<p>
"We are in for it now!" cried Dave, as
he watched the approach of the two war
canoes loaded down with savages.
</p>

<p>
"It certainly looks like it," muttered
Captain Broadbeam, grimly.  "Well, a man can
die but once, and we had better fight to the
bitter end."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," came from Doctor Barrell.
"But I am afraid that three against two
dozen or more will make a poor showing."
</p>

<p>
The savages now became aware that they
were discovered, and they set up a fierce
shout.  Those at the long sweeps began to
row more swiftly than ever, as if thirsting
for the blood of the whites.
</p>

<p>
"If we only had a gun or two," said Dave.
"But we haven't a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Only the oars, and they'll make poor
weapons," answered Captain Broadbeam,
"I'm afraid it's all up with us, lad.  We
must look for the worst."
</p>

<p>
"Can't we outdistance them by rowing?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not."
</p>

<p>
"But we might reach shore again and take
to the jungle.  That will be better than being
slaughtered on the ocean."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, let us try for the shore!" burst
out the doctor.  "We have at least a fighting
chance of reaching it."
</p>

<p>
As quickly as possible the rowboat was
turned about, and its bow pointed to a distant
headland.  All pulled with might and main,
the perspiration pouring down their faces
and backs.
</p>

<p>
But it was useless.  The war canoes crept
closer and closer.
</p>

<p>
And now, as if to make doubly sure of
them, there suddenly appeared upon the
beach another crowd of natives, brandishing
knives and war clubs.
</p>

<p>
The din was hideous, and the cry from the
shore was echoed and re-echoed by the
savages in the canoes.
</p>

<p>
They felt certain that the whites would
become their prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Captain, doctor, and young diver looked
at each other with blanched faces.
</p>

<p>
They felt that their last hour on earth was
at hand.
</p>

<p>
Swiftly the war canoes came closer.
</p>

<p>
Then of a sudden something happened
which came as a great shock to our friends
and as an even greater shock to the savages.
</p>

<p>
Boom!
</p>

<p>
Dull and sullen a ship's gun boomed out
and a shot sped across the bow of the
foremost of the canoes.
</p>

<p>
"A shot!" ejaculated Captain Broadbeam,
leaping to his feet.  "What can it
mean?"
</p>

<p>
"It means that there is a steamship in
sight!" cried Dave.  "See the smoke around
the bend of the island.  Here she comes!"
</p>

<p>
"It is the <i>Swallow</i>!" came from the
doctor.  "Heaven be praised!"
</p>

<p>
The physician was right; it was indeed
the <i>Swallow</i>, and now another shot boomed
out.
</p>

<p>
The ball struck the stern of the leading war
canoe, and the craft began immediately to fill
with water.
</p>

<p>
The yelling was terrific, for the natives
were taken completely by surprise.
</p>

<p>
As the first of the canoes began to sink,
those on board leaped into the water.
</p>

<p>
Some started for the other canoe, but the
majority swam toward shore, thinking that
the second craft would soon be served like the
first.
</p>

<p>
But the natives on the shore were not yet
daunted, and with another yell they let fly
a shower of arrows at those in the rowboat.
</p>

<p>
"Down!" cried Captain Broadbeam, and
all hurled themselves to the bottom of the
craft.
</p>

<p>
It was well that they did this, for the
arrows must otherwise have killed one or
more of them.
</p>

<p>
Boom!  A third shot from the <i>Swallow</i> was
now directed at those on shore.
</p>

<p>
The aim was a good one and two natives
were seen to pitch forward, to rise no
more.
</p>

<p>
Seeing this, the others took to their heels
with all speed and disappeared into the
jungle.
</p>

<p>
It was the last of the attack upon our
friends.
</p>

<p>
The savages had had enough of the contest
and now thought only of saving themselves.
</p>

<p>
The second canoe was beached in a great
hurry and the occupants disappeared as if
by magic.
</p>

<p>
As soon as they felt free to do so, our
friends resumed their oars and rowed in the
direction of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
On the deck they saw the lieutenant of the
ship, Amos Fearless, and several other
familiar faces.
</p>

<p>
Soon the steamship and the rowboat came
together, and then Bob and Pat Stoodles were
hoisted aboard the larger craft.  Dave, the
captain, and the doctor followed.
</p>

<p>
"Father!" cried Dave, and rushed into
his parent's arms.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless could not speak, but his
face showed plainly his great joy.
</p>

<p>
"And how are you, father?" went on his son.
</p>

<p>
"He is doing nicely," answered the first
mate of the <i>Swallow</i>.  "But his speech has
not yet come back to him."
</p>

<p>
Bob and Pat Stoodles were carried to staterooms,
and here Doctor Barrell proceeded to
minister to their comforts through the stock
in his medicine chest.
</p>

<p>
While this was going on Captain Broadbeam
started in to learn if Pete Rackley had
shown himself.
</p>

<p>
"Why, certainly; he is on board," said the
mate.  "He's a poor, down-hearted cast-away,
isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"He's a rascal!" burst out Captain
Broadbeam.  "Where is he?  I'll put him in irons!"
</p>

<p>
A search was at once instituted and at last
Pete Rackley was found hiding in the forecastle.
</p>

<p>
He was the picture of misery when brought
before Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"It's all a mistake," he said, in a
trembling voice.  "All a mistake."
</p>

<p>
"It is no mistake," said the captain,
sternly.  "Dave Fearless is here to testify
against you."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You need make no more denials, Rackley.
You have played the game and lost.  Now
answer me truthfully: Have you done any
harm as yet to the <i>Swallow</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No! no!"
</p>

<p>
"You are telling the truth?"
</p>

<p>
"I am&mdash;I swear it."
</p>

<p>
"I will order a strict investigation.  If
anything is wrong&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And the captain ended with a stern shake
of his forefinger at the rascal.
</p>

<p>
Pete Rackley was then bound and cast into
the brig of the ship.
</p>

<p>
The assistant engineer was closely
questioned, and he said Rackley had been seen
frequently around the engine room.
</p>

<p>
Then the entire machinery of the ship was
inspected.
</p>

<p>
At one point several bolts were found filed
almost in two.
</p>

<p>
At another point an oil cup was broken, so
that the part might get dry and thus cause
considerable delay.
</p>

<p>
These things were all mended, and Captain
Broadbeam ordered that Rackley be chained
up in the brig because of his falsehoods.
</p>

<p>
The day was spent in the vicinity of the
island, looking for the <i>Raven</i>, but that vessel
failed to appear.
</p>

<p>
By the next morning both Bob and Pat
Stoodles were pronounced out of danger by
the doctor.
</p>

<p>
A conference was held and it was decided
that the <i>Swallow</i> should now proceed with all
haste to the spot where the <i>Happy Hour</i> had
gone down with the treasure.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of special interest happened for
several days.
</p>

<p>
Bob Vilett grew better rapidly and was
able to be around at the end of a week.
</p>

<p>
Pat Stoodles' recovery was slower.  But
to the satisfaction of the friends he had made
it was seen that the Irish castaway's mind
was becoming clearer every day.
</p>

<p>
"He'll be as clear-headed as any of us
when he gets on his feet once more," said
Doctor Barrell, and his statement proved correct.
</p>

<p>
Day after day went by and the <i>Swallow</i>
kept steadily to her course.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless was now as well as ever
excepting for his voice.
</p>

<p>
He could occasionally speak a few words
in a hoarse whisper, but that was all; and he
would sometimes break down in the midst of
a sentence.
</p>

<p>
This grieved Dave very much, but he could
do nothing for the sufferer.
</p>

<p>
"It is time alone can do it," said Doctor
Barrell, encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
But Dave was downcast.  What if his
father should never be able to talk again as
of old?
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather let the fortune go than have
that happen," he told himself, over and over
again.  He was afraid that the affliction
might grow worse, so that his parent would
not be able to make any sound at all!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
ATTACKED BY A FIRE FISH
</h3>

<p>
"And this is the spot where the <i>Happy
Hour</i> went down?"
</p>

<p>
"It is, according to the markings on the
chart, Dave."
</p>

<p>
"And how deep do you reckon the ocean
is at this point?"
</p>

<p>
"The chart says 12,500 feet&mdash;a little over
two miles."
</p>

<p>
"It is a deep distance.  Regular divers
could never make it.  They would be crushed
to death by the mere pressure of the water."
</p>

<p>
"I have thought the matter over, Dave,
and I think it will be best for both you and
your father to go down only a half-mile the
first day.  Then, if that is successful, you can
go a little deeper each day, until the bottom
is reached.  And you will have to use the
diving bell at all times."
</p>

<p>
"I know that.  And if we leave the diving
bell at all it will have to be in those new
steel-ribbed diving suits we had made in Washington
especially for this trip," concluded the
young diver.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Swallow</i> lay at rest on the broad bosom
of the mighty Pacific Ocean.
</p>

<p>
Nothing had been seen of the <i>Raven</i>, and
at present not a sign of a strange sail showed
itself anywhere.
</p>

<p>
It was high noon, and Captain Broadbeam
had just concluded his calculations to prove
that he was at the very spot which was said
to be that where the <i>Happy Hour</i> had
sunk.
</p>

<p>
Dave looked thoughtfully over the side, into
the greenish waves, lit for a depth of only
thirty or forty feet below the surface.
</p>

<p>
What fortune did that silent body of water
hold for his father and himself?
</p>

<p>
A touch on his elbow aroused him, and
turning, he found his parent standing beside
him.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless could not say a word, but
he motioned to the water and smiled.  Then
he spoke to Dave in the sign language of the
divers.
</p>

<p>
"This is the spot," he signed.  "How
soon does Captain Broadbeam calculate to let
us go down?"
</p>

<p>
"I think to-morrow," replied Dave.
</p>

<p>
A long talk followed, by word of mouth on
Dave's part and by signs on the part of the
parent.
</p>

<p>
It was a sad sight to see Amos Fearless try
to talk with his mouth and fail.  His tongue
would cling to his teeth and refuse to budge.
At last he turned away with tears in his eyes
and Dave was equally affected.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the day was spent in getting
the diving bell into shape for use.
</p>

<p>
This was inspected with great care, for it
was understood by all that the two divers,
father and son, would be taking their lives in
their hands in going down such an immense
distance as contemplated.
</p>

<p>
"It's queer we don't see anything of the
<i>Raven</i>," said Dave to Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps Lemuel Hankers knows enough
to keep out of our reach," was the answer.
"He may know that we&mdash;or rather, you&mdash;are
on board and have exposed Pete Rackley,
and he may wish to keep his own head out of
danger."
</p>

<p>
"That must be it."
</p>

<p>
"If Hankers came near us I would be apt
to make it hot for him."
</p>

<p>
"And I'll do the same."
</p>

<p>
It was a clear day overhead when Dave and
his father entered the diving bell and were
hoisted over the side of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the immense cable unwound itself,
letting the bell down deeper and deeper.
</p>

<p>
Soon the light of day was shut out and all
became as black as night and as cold as a
tomb.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless turned on the electric current
and the diving bell sent out several rays
of light.
</p>

<p>
The light attracted numerous fish, who
swam up swiftly, only to stop just as fast and
gaze stupidly through the glass of the bell's
sides.
</p>

<p>
There was one fish in particular, commonly
called the electric-light fish, the scientific
name being linophyrne lucifer, which had
what looked like an electric light on the end
of its sharp snout and a rope-like appendage
under its lower jaw.  It had a square mouth
and sharp, curved teeth, and a look which
was enough to give an ordinary mortal a
chill.
</p>

<p>
"We must secure a specimen of that fish,"
said Amos Fearless, in the sign language.
"The captain and the doctor spoke about it
particularly."
</p>

<p>
"And also a specimen of that long, thin
thing," answered Dave, pointing to what is
familiarly called in Borneo the ray of fire.
The ray of fire is a white fish four or five feet
long and less than three inches thick.  It has
silver scales which flash out like fire whenever
it swims quickly.
</p>

<p>
Soon they had reached the half-mile limit,
and the diving bell came to a standstill.
</p>

<p>
Then a door in the bell was opened and
they prepared to spread out a strong net with
which to catch what was desired.
</p>

<p>
It was by no means an easy task&mdash;indeed,
the most of a diver's labors are very hard,
and before the net was properly adjusted
both Dave and his parent were almost
winded.
</p>

<p>
Then they moved the diving bell around,
from one spot to another, on the lookout for
the electric-light fish and the ray of fire, so
called.
</p>

<p>
Soon they saw one of the electric-light fish
in the vicinity.
</p>

<p>
They had brought some bait along, and this
was tied up in the net.
</p>

<p>
The monstrous fish scented the bait and
came forward slowly and cautiously.
</p>

<p>
He was hungry, yet he did not altogether
like the appearance of the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
He had never seen a live human being
before, although he had feasted upon the body
of more than one dead sailor, coming down
with some wreck.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless and Dave remained as
motionless as statues.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer came the electric-light
fish.
</p>

<p>
The light on his snout blinked and winked
in an odd fashion and was once or twice
turned upon Dave and his father.
</p>

<p>
Then, like a flash, the monstrous fish swept
into the net after the bait.
</p>

<p>
Snap!  went the line attached to the top of
the net, and Dave and his father began pulling
the net shut with might and main.
</p>

<p>
They had to work like lightning, for, feeling
that something was wrong, the electric-light
fish began to thrash around at a lively
rate.
</p>

<p>
The net swept to and fro as the fish darted
hither and thither in its efforts to escape.
</p>

<p>
Bang!
</p>

<p>
Up against the diving bell came net and
fish with a shock that threatened to shiver the
glass into a million fragments.
</p>

<p>
"Shove away!" motioned Amos Fearless
to his son, and Dave caught hold of a rod to
which the net was fastened and the net was
placed at a distance from the bell.
</p>

<p>
At last the wonderful electric-light fish was
a prisoner in the net.  It still continued to
thrash around, and fearful that he might
break loose in spite of the strength of the net,
Amos Fearless signaled to those on the ship
to haul up the prize.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the net ascended until it was out of
sight and only the occasional blinking of the
fish's light lit up the path he was taking to the
outside world.  Then even this died out.
</p>

<p>
"A good haul," said Amos Fearless, in the
sign language.  "Now for that ray of fire and
our day's work will be done.  And I will be
glad of it."
</p>

<p>
"So will I be glad," answered Dave.
"We'll want several days down here in order
to get used to deep-sea work once more."
</p>

<p>
The diving bell was supplied with a second
net&mdash;smaller and of a much tighter mesh, and
this they now put out in the hope of catching
one of the rays of fire.
</p>

<p>
Two were in the vicinity and eying the bell
and those inside with much curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Nasty, snaky-looking things," observed
Dave, as he helped to bait the net.  "And
they look wicked, too."
</p>

<p>
"All of the deep-sea fish are wicked-looking,"
was the answer.  "I never saw anything different."
</p>

<p>
They waited for fully ten minutes before
one of the strange fishes came up to the net.
</p>

<p>
Then it darted inside and began biting at
the bait.
</p>

<p>
"We've got him!" cried Dave, and began
to pull on the string which shut the net up.
</p>

<p>
At once the ray of fire tried to escape.
</p>

<p>
But it was too late, for the top of the net
closed tight just as he shoved his nose against it.
</p>

<p>
Then an odd thing happened.
</p>

<p>
The fish began to lash around in a circle,
emitting a strange sound like the roll of
distant thunder.
</p>

<p>
Sparks flew from its tail which dropped
down into the water like the sparks from a
Roman candle.
</p>

<p>
"What a beautiful sight!" began Dave,
when of a sudden he heard a swishing through
the water.
</p>

<p>
He turned, to behold his father in a truly
perilous situation.
</p>

<p>
The second ray of fire had come up
and wound itself around Amos Fearless'
neck.
</p>

<p>
Its hard body was like a wand of rubber,
and unless the fish were released the old diver
would speedily be strangled to death!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap25"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
LEFT TO PERISH
</h3>

<p>
For one moment Dave Fearless' heart
seemed to stop beating.
</p>

<p>
The sight before him was a terrible one.
</p>

<p>
Vainly was his father struggling to free
himself from the deadly embrace of the
creature which had attacked him.
</p>

<p>
There were three coils of the ray of fire
around the old diver's neck and these were
slowly but surely choking the life out of the
man.
</p>

<p>
His eyes were bulging from their sockets&mdash;his
tongue stuck from his mouth.  In a few
seconds more all would be over.
</p>

<p>
Close at hand stuck a knife in a case on the
wall of the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
With a leap Dave secured the blade.  Another
leap and he was at his parent's side.
</p>

<p>
But how should he attack the strange,
snake-like fish?  A false cut and he might stab
his father in the throat.
</p>

<p>
But he must act, or it would be too late.
</p>

<p>
With a cautious movement of the knife he
slit the fish along the back.
</p>

<p>
There was a strange hissing and the ray of
fire swung loose the end of its tail.
</p>

<p>
It caught Dave around the wrist, holding
that member as in a vise.
</p>

<p>
At first the youth was inclined to drop the
knife, but he managed to hold on.
</p>

<p>
Then began an intensely interesting struggle between boy and fish.
</p>

<p>
Dave tried his best to twist the hand around
so that he might cut the fish a second time.
</p>

<p>
He brought up his other hand, in an endeavor
to transfer the knife, but as quick
as a flash the ray of fire unloosened itself and
caught both wrists.
</p>

<p>
In its own way it was fighting for its mate,
a prisoner in the net.
</p>

<p>
Dave's two hands were now drawn tightly
to his father's throat, as if the horrible
monster of the deep meant to make the boy
strangle his own parent!
</p>

<p>
"I must get my hand free!" thought the
young diver.
</p>

<p>
Again he struggled, the sweat standing
out on his forehead inside of his diving
helmet.
</p>

<p>
At last he managed to turn one wrist and
got the point of the knife again into the fish's
body.
</p>

<p>
He cut and twisted as best he could and felt
the ray of fire quiver with pain and rage.
</p>

<p>
The fish could not stand the cutting and
presently raised its head in order to make a
new move.
</p>

<p>
Exerting all of his strength, Dave made a
slash at the head and cut into the light on the
fish's snout.
</p>

<p>
A rush of phosphorescent blood followed,
and on the instant all of the light died out in
the creature's body.
</p>

<p>
Again Dave made a cut, striking deep into
the fish, so deeply in fact that he made an ugly
scratch on his father's neck.
</p>

<p>
This last blow was too much for the ray of
fire, and slowly it fell away and floated off,
Dave did not know to where.
</p>

<p>
Freed from his captor, Amos Fearless sank
in a heap at the door of the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
Was he dead?
</p>

<p>
In frantic haste the youth pulled himself
and his parent into the bell and shut the
door.
</p>

<p>
Then he gave a quick signal to be raised to
the surface.
</p>

<p>
There was no immediate answer, and a
fresh alarm took possession of the young
diver.
</p>

<p>
"What does this mean?  Why don't they
pull us up?" he asked himself.
</p>

<p>
Generally the life-line, as it is termed, is
watched constantly, and every signal of a
diver is acted upon on the instant.
</p>

<p>
Were this not so, many a man of the deep
would go down never to come up.
</p>

<p>
A minute went by and still the signal
remained unanswered.
</p>

<p>
To the boy the time seemed an age.
</p>

<p>
Feeling that his parent might die before
being brought up, he began to empty the
diving bell of water.
</p>

<p>
There was a fresh-air hose attached to the
bell, and as the water was forced out the air
came in, until at last the bell was as dry as a
hogshead that has been emptied.
</p>

<p>
The moment the water was out, Dave began
to work upon his diving suit.
</p>

<p>
It was no easy job to get it off without assistance.
</p>

<p>
Generally one diver helped the other, but
he could obtain no aid from that form now
lying stiff and motionless upon the floor of
the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
At last his arms and his head were free and
he turned his attention to his parent.
</p>

<p>
He unscrewed the helmet and then the rest
of the old diver's suit.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless was almost black in the face
and there was an ugly mark around his throat,
mingling with the blood from the scratch
Dave had caused.
</p>

<p>
Putting his ear to his parent's breast, the
boy made out that his father still breathed
faintly.
</p>

<p>
In the diving bell was some liquor, to be
used for restorative purposes, and some of
this Dave poured down his father's throat.
</p>

<p>
But still the man did not stir, and Dave
began to rub his hands and move his arms, that
his lungs might again get into working order.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes passed and at last Amos Fearless
gave a slight gasp.
</p>

<p>
Taking this for a good sign, Dave continued
his labors and was presently rewarded by
seeing his father open his eyes and shudder.
</p>

<p>
"Father! are you all right now?" asked
the boy.
</p>

<p>
The only reply was a groan.  But then
Amos Fearless gave a long breath, and Dave
knew that he was saved.
</p>

<p>
"You had a narrow escape, father," he
said.  "The light fish tried to strangle you.
I had to cut him to pieces with the knife.  I
cut you a little on the neck, but that couldn't
be helped."
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless made a feeble sign.  "I
know&mdash;brave boy," was what he said, and
caught his son by the hand.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the ray of fire in the net
was still threshing around on the outside of
the bell.
</p>

<p>
But to this fish they now paid no attention.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go up," signed Mr. Fearless, after
a pause of a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
"I have signaled," was the son's answer.
"I will signal again."
</p>

<p>
He pulled the cord several times in lively
fashion.
</p>

<p>
Then he waited&mdash;five seconds&mdash;ten seconds&mdash;a
full minute.  And still the diving bell did
not move.
</p>

<p>
"They have given up watching the lifeline,"
he reasoned.  "How careless!  I'll
give Captain Broadbeam a talking to when
they do haul us up."
</p>

<p>
"Something must be wrong," said the
father, in his sign language.  "Captain
Broadbeam would not forget us in this
fashion."
</p>

<p>
Slowly the minutes went by and each
instant father and son grew more anxious.
</p>

<p>
They could not ascend of themselves, nor
could they leave the diving bell and float to
the surface.
</p>

<p>
Had they left the bell without their suits
the water would have crushed them, for the
pressure was enormous at this distance under
the surface.
</p>

<p>
The air in the diving bell was anything but
pure, and now of a sudden it stopped coming
in altogether.
</p>

<p>
"We are lost!" cried Dave.  "We shall
be smothered to death!"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot believe Captain Broadbeam has
forgotten us," signed Amos Fearless.  "As
I said before, something must be wrong!"
</p>

<p>
The old diver was right; something was
very wrong on board of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
While the two divers were at work under
the surface of the ocean, a wild cry had arisen
on board of the ship, a cry which thrilled
everyone who heard it to the heart.
</p>

<p>
It came from the cook's galley and was
quickly taken up on all sides.
</p>

<p>
"Fire! fire!  The ship is on fire!"
</p>

<p>
The report was true.  Some fat on the
cook's stove had boiled over and taken fire,
and now the burning fat was flowing in all
directions.
</p>

<p>
It looked as if the <i>Swallow</i> and all on board
of her were doomed!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
THE BATTLE OF THE FISHES
</h3>

<p>
"Fire! fire! fire!"
</p>

<p>
This cry, echoing throughout the <i>Swallow</i>,
is the most dreadful that sailors on the high
seas know.
</p>

<p>
What hope is there for those on board of a
ship going down in mid-ocean, thousands of
miles from land?
</p>

<p>
"We must put out that fire!" came from
Captain Broadbeam.  "Man the fire hose and
send word to the engine room to turn on the
water!"
</p>

<p>
His orders were obeyed as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Yet everything takes time, and before the
hose could be brought into play the cook's
galley was a mass of flames from beginning
to end.
</p>

<p>
The wind was blowing the sparks directly
forward, so the captain had the ship swung
round, that the fire might be carried largely
over the side.
</p>

<p>
A bucket corps was formed and they, too,
poured all the water possible on the conflagration.
</p>

<p>
It was fierce, hot work, and for some time
it looked as if the fire would get the best of
the workers and destroy the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
Small wonder then that Amos Fearless and
Dave were for the time being forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes went by&mdash;twenty minutes&mdash;and
both began to grow desperate.
</p>

<p>
"We must perish!" groaned Dave.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless shook his head, dismally.
</p>

<p>
Both became too weak to stand up, and sank
on the floor of the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
The air was now stale and made them sleepy.
</p>

<p>
Gradually Dave's eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
He tried to arouse himself, but the effort
was a failure.
</p>

<p>
It was the beginning of the sleep of death,
and the young diver knew it!
</p>

<p>
He caught his father's hand and a warm
grasp was exchanged in silence.
</p>

<p>
After that all became as a dream to the
young diver.
</p>

<p>
He thought he was out in the ocean and
that numerous fierce fish were swimming close
to him.
</p>

<p>
Then one large fish swallowed him and he
found himself cut off from all air.
</p>

<p>
He fought desperately and at last cut a hole
in the fish's side and stepped out into the
upper world.
</p>

<p>
Oh, how good the fresh air tasted.  He filled
his lungs and took breath after breath&mdash;and
then&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Dave opened his eyes and stared vacantly
around him.  He was on the deck of the
<i>Swallow</i> and Doctor Barrell was bending over
him, a look of deep anxiety on the kindly
face.
</p>

<p>
"Dave, how do you feel now!" came in
anxious tones.  "Can you breathe?"
</p>

<p>
He could not answer excepting to take a
long breath; but he now understood the
situation.  He had been hauled up to the
<i>Swallow's</i> deck and was saved!  Then of a sudden
he became unconscious again.
</p>

<p>
Quarter of an hour later Dave found himself
sitting up and swallowing some medicine
Doctor Barrell was forcing into his mouth.
He still felt very weak, and when he tried to
stand, all swam before his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You must keep quiet, lad," said the
doctor.  "You have had a narrow escape from
death."
</p>

<p>
"My father&mdash;&mdash;" began Dave.  He could
say no more.
</p>

<p>
"He was brought up with you, of course."
</p>

<p>
"And is he&mdash;is he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He is slowly recovering, but of course he
is older than you and not so strong, and it
will, consequently, take longer."
</p>

<p>
"But he will get well?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so."
</p>

<p>
After that Dave was silent for a long while.
Then Captain Broadbeam came in, his face
covered with smoke and grime.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you thought we had deserted
you," said the captain.  "We had a hot time
of it, I can tell you."
</p>

<p>
"A hot time?  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know the ship has been afire, lad?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it has been, and that's why we
didn't haul you up before.  I was afraid we
were all bound for Davy Jones' locker, sure."
</p>

<p>
Of course, Dave was surprised and he listened
to the particulars of the fire with interest.
</p>

<p>
"The galley is burned off clean and clear,"
said the captain, "and we've got an ugly hole
in the forward deck.  But otherwise the ship
is all right."
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the day was spent in
cleaning up the muss, and then the ship's
carpenter went to work, with several sailor
assistants, to build a new galley and mend the
burned deck.
</p>

<p>
It was several days before Dave felt able
to do any more diving, and even then it was
only the thought of locating the sunken
treasure that made him go down.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless was too weak to do anything,
so Dave had to go down alone.
</p>

<p>
"Be sure and pull me up," said the young
diver, as he was about to enter the diving
bell.
</p>

<p>
"I will see to that," replied Amos Fearless,
in his sign language.  "Don't stay down
too long."
</p>

<p>
Down and down into the dark and cold
waters of the Pacific sank the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
The trip before had been about half a mile;
this time Dave intended to go down twice that
distance.
</p>

<p>
If this trip was successful he was resolved,
on the next day, weather permitting, to go
down to the very bottom, two miles below the
surface.
</p>

<p>
After what seemed a journey without end
the diving bell came to a stop.
</p>

<p>
The mile limit had been reached.
</p>

<p>
The young diver turned on the electric
lights and gazed around him, curiously.
</p>

<p>
He gave a start of surprise, and not
without reason.
</p>

<p>
The waters were no longer dark and black.
</p>

<p>
There was a peculiar glow of light coming
up from somewhere below, and in the water
floated something closely resembling smoke
or clouds.
</p>

<p>
"What did this mean!"
</p>

<p>
"It's like another world," he thought.
"And what strange fish!"
</p>

<p>
But then he caught sight of something
which filled him with alarm.
</p>

<p>
A number of small fish had come up around
the diving bell and were now swarming all
over it, inside and out.
</p>

<p>
Each fish was less than six inches long, but
there were hundreds of them darting hither
and thither, churning up the water as before,
and emitting a strange, hissing sound.
</p>

<p>
He tried to get back to the diving bell, but
found the effort a failure.
</p>

<p>
The fish swam against him, plunging and
leaping, and finally turned him completely
over.
</p>

<p>
He was in the power of a new enemy, and
what the end of this adventure would be there
was no telling.
</p>

<p>
The fish were indeed curious&mdash;some long
and thin, others short and fat, but all with
something extremely unusual in their makeup.
</p>

<p>
One fish had horns on its head, another had
wings like those of a bird, and many had
feathers instead of scales on their bodies.
</p>

<p>
And then came a fish shaped very much
like a long, spiral spring, with a square-looking
head and horns all of two feet long just
over his eyes, which set out like two yellow
and white eggs.
</p>

<p>
"I must try and get you, my beauty,"
thought the young diver, and prepared to put
out the net for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
He had to work with care, being alone, and
it took considerable time before he opened
the diving bell and let in the water.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that struck him when he felt
the water on him was that it was no longer
cold, but warm&mdash;even warmer than at the surface.
</p>

<p>
This was not unpleasant, but he could not
help but wonder how much hotter it might be
at the very bottom.
</p>

<p>
"This part of the ocean may be over a
submarine volcano," he reasoned.  "If that
is so it will be boiling at the bottom, and to
get to the wreck will be impossible."
</p>

<p>
At last his net was set and he baited it with
care.
</p>

<p>
Then he waited.
</p>

<p>
Several small fish came up and nibbled
at his bait, but not the spiral fish he was
after.
</p>

<p>
"He's a shy one," thought Dave.  "He's
not going to be caught if he knows it."
</p>

<p>
But at last the young diver was rewarded
by seeing two of the spiral fish approaching.
</p>

<p>
One apparently urged the other on, until
both came into the net and began to chew at
the bait, which was purposely very tough.
</p>

<p>
With all speed Dave set to work to shut the
net.
</p>

<p>
This was no easy task for a single person,
and in order to accomplish it the young diver
had to step outside of the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
He was just finishing up the task when a
strange rushing behind him caused him to
turn around.
</p>

<p>
At first he could see but little, for the water
behind him was churned up into a milk-white
foam.  Then he saw a great mass of little
fishes pressing toward him.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br><br>
THE RIVAL DIVERS
</h3>

<p>
"Gosh, but this is something new!"
</p>

<p>
So thought Dave Fearless as he tried to
pass the little fish in order to get into the
diving bell.
</p>

<p>
But the little chaps were both frisky and
powerful and got in his way continually.
</p>

<p>
They smelt of his legs, his body and his
head, and then each gave him a resounding
slap with the tail.
</p>

<p>
It was like a hundred tack hammers playing
a tattoo over his entire body.
</p>

<p>
Never had the young diver been in such a
peculiar position before.
</p>

<p>
At last he hit out straight ahead of him.
</p>

<p>
It was like striking into a mass of jelly.
</p>

<p>
The little fish flew in all directions, only to
return the moment the young diver's arm was
hauled back.
</p>

<p>
Slowly but surely, however, he got closer to
the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
At last he gained the door and hauled
himself inside by main strength.
</p>

<p>
The bell was full of the tiny fish, and he had
literally to squeeze them out in order to
squeeze himself in.
</p>

<p>
Once in the bell he hardly knew what to do
next.
</p>

<p>
To shut the door under the circumstances
was out of the question.
</p>

<p>
Yet he could not remain below the surface
forever.
</p>

<p>
But while he was meditating upon the
unexpected turn of affairs some other fish came
to his aid.
</p>

<p>
They were long, fat fellows, with stomachs
on them resembling balloons.
</p>

<p>
There were a score or more of them, and
they began to gobble down the little fish as
rapidly as they could swallow them.
</p>

<p>
A fight ensued between the little fish and
the big fish, and in the end nearly all of the
fish of both sorts left the vicinity of the diving
bell for parts unknown.
</p>

<p>
Realizing what was going on, Dave watched
his chance and when only a few of each kind
of fish remained in the diving bell he shut the
door.
</p>

<p>
Then he began to pump out the water, and
at the same time signaled to those on the ship
to raise him to the surface.
</p>

<p>
"A splendid haul!" cried Doctor Barrell,
on examining his strange catch.  "Two spiral
whipsnaps, to use the vulgar name, and half
a dozen fish which are new to science."
</p>

<p>
Captain Broadbeam had taken up one of
the little fish and was examining it with interest.
</p>

<p>
The fish was dead, having been cut open
during the struggle in the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
"He's got something inside of him that
don't belong there, I reckon," said the
captain.  "Creation, look here!"
</p>

<p>
And he held up&mdash;a small gold coin!
</p>

<p>
"A gold coin!" cried Dave.  "A Chinese
piece, too!"
</p>

<p>
"You are right," said Doctor Barrell.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it came from the sunken treasure,"
put in Amos Fearless, who stood near.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Then the treasure must be down here, at
the bottom of the ocean," added Dave.
</p>

<p>
"It's not unlikely," said the doctor.
"Although such a fish might swim a long distance
with such a coin in his insides."
</p>

<p>
While the party was talking the matter
over, and Doctor Barrell was preparing to
place the spiral fish in a safe place, there came
a cry from the lookout:
</p>

<p>
"Sail oh!"
</p>

<p>
"Where away?" cried Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"Dead ahead, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Can you make her out?"
</p>

<p>
"A steamer, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it is the <i>Raven</i>," said Dave.
And his heart gave a leap.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the newcomer came closer until, at
noon, she was within hailing distance.
</p>

<p>
She was really the <i>Raven</i> and she came
up boldly, with Lemuel Hankers, Bart, and
several others on her deck.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Raven</i> would have gained the spot
several days before, but an unexpected
breakdown of her machinery had caused a delay.
</p>

<p>
The wait was maddening to Lemuel Hankers
and his son, yet their rage did them no
good.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Raven</i> came to a standstill when
within hailing distance of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Raven</i>, ahoy!" shouted Captain Broadbeam,
through his speaking trumpet.
</p>

<p>
"Ahoy, the <i>Swallow</i>!" came back from
Captain Nesik.
</p>

<p>
"You're a pretty set of rascals!" burst
out the honest commander of the Government
vessel.
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk that way to us!" retorted
Captain Nesik.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you rescue us from the savages?"
</p>

<p>
"We were running on a reef and had to
look after our ship," was the lame excuse.
</p>

<p>
"You're a set of rascals!" burst out Dave
Fearless, and he shook his fist at those on the
<i>Raven</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Don't call me a rascal!" ejaculated Lemuel
Hankers.
</p>

<p>
"But you are one, and your son is
another," came from Dave.  "The mask is off,
and in the future you had better keep
your distance, or there will be trouble for
you."
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing here?" demanded
Bart, leaning on the rail.
</p>

<p>
"You know well enough."
</p>

<p>
"You are after the sunken treasure."
</p>

<p>
"If we are it is because it belongs to my
father and myself," retorted Dave.
</p>

<p>
"We are on the high seas," came from
Lemuel Hankers.  "The treasure was abandoned,
and it will belong to whoever succeeds
in raising it&mdash;if it can be raised."
</p>

<p>
"By gum!  I reckon he's right there," muttered
Captain Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we intend to raise it, so you had
better clear out," said Dave, boldly.
</p>

<p>
At this there arose a howl of derision from
those on the <i>Raven</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead and do as you please," came
from Lemuel Hankers.  "But let me tell you,
you have got to have pretty slick divers to get
ahead of those I have hired."
</p>

<p>
"Whom have you?" questioned Captain
Broadbeam, curiously.
</p>

<p>
"I am not afraid to let you know&mdash;Cal
Vixen and Sam Walton."
</p>

<p>
At this announcement the faces of Captain
Broadbeam, Amos Fearless, and Dave fell.
</p>

<p>
Cal Vixen and Sam Walton were known to
be the best divers on the Pacific coast.
</p>

<p>
What Amos Fearless and his son had done
on the Atlantic shore for the Government,
Cal Vixen and Sam Walton had accomplished
on the Pacific shore.
</p>

<p>
"Rivals for fair!" murmured Dave.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my lad," answered Captain Broadbeam.
"I reckon it will be nip an' tuck between
ye!" And he shook his head doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
There was a pause in the talk.
</p>

<p>
"Have you a castaway on board?" questioned
Lemuel Hankers, at length.
</p>

<p>
"No, but we've got a prisoner named Pete
Rackley," answered Captain Broadbeam,
with, a chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"A prisoner!"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly&mdash;and you know what for, Lemuel
Hankers, you old fraud!" said Dave.
</p>

<p>
"I?  I know nothing."
</p>

<p>
"You know everything.  Your well-laid
plot failed to work, and Pete Rackley shall
remain a prisoner until we can hand him over
to the United States authorities."
</p>

<p>
A wordy quarrel followed, and presently
the two rival divers came forward.
</p>

<p>
"We are going down to-morrow," said
Vixen, the leader of the pair.  "If you go
down, mind and keep your distance."
</p>

<p>
"You mind and keep yours!" retorted
Dave.  "Remember, neither I nor my father
can be scared by you."
</p>

<p>
"We have been hired to bring up that
treasure and we mean to do it."
</p>

<p>
"I expect to do the same thing&mdash;and you
shall not stop me."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Only look out, or you'll be
running up a lot of trouble on your back!"
came from Vixen, and then he and his mate
fell back, and the two ships drifted apart, out
of talking distance.
</p>

<p>
"They mean business," said Dave, to Captain
Broadbeam.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and they will cause you a lot of trouble
if they can," replied the captain.  "Watch
them closely, every time they come near you."
</p>

<p>
The next day the hunt for the sunken treasure
began in earnest.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
<br><br>
THE DEMONS OF THE DEEP
</h3>

<p>
As early in the day as possible Captain
Broadbeam made another astronomical
calculation and worked out the position of the
<i>Swallow</i> on his set of charts.
</p>

<p>
It was found that the ship lay about one
hundred yards to the westward of where the
<i>Happy Hour</i> was reported to have gone down.
</p>

<p>
This was not much, but the captain immediately
gave orders that the ship be brought
to the correct position.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have work enough locating her as
it is," said the captain.  "More than likely
the ocean current has shifted her considerably."
</p>

<p>
Luckily Amos Fearless was now feeling
much better, having quite recovered from his
experience at the time of the fire on the ship.
</p>

<p>
With the <i>Raven</i> on the scene, it was decided
by father and son that the diving bell should
be taken directly to the ocean's bottom, if the
thing could be accomplished.
</p>

<p>
"I know we are running a risk," said the
old diver, in his sign language, "but we must
be the first to discover the <i>Happy Hour</i>, no
matter what the cost.  To suffer defeat would
kill me."
</p>

<p>
By ten o'clock in the morning the diving
bell was over the side and father and son had
entered it.
</p>

<p>
Those on the <i>Raven</i> were also getting out a
diving bell, and Vixen and Walton were busy
overhauling their deep-sea outfits.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed to be a race for the treasure.
</p>

<p>
Soon Dave and his parent had left the
outside world behind and were going down and
down into the mighty ocean's depths.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion it had been agreed not to
look for anything but the sunken treasure
ship; consequently, the fish net and several
other similar appliances had been left behind.
</p>

<p>
In their places the diving bell contained
several tools for digging and hauling and also
several under-water firearms, for use against
a possible enemy.  In addition to the firearms,
father and son had provided themselves with
long and sharp knives.
</p>

<p>
"There is no telling what we may run
across away down there," said Amos Fearless,
in his sign language.  "We are taking
our lives in our hands, to my way of thinking."
</p>

<p>
And what he said was true&mdash;as events
speedily proved.
</p>

<p>
Soon they passed through the darker portion
of the ocean and knew that the first mile
of the downward journey had been covered.
</p>

<p>
Then those above lowered more slowly and
watched keenly for the first signal that
danger might be encountered by those below.
</p>

<p>
"See, it is growing lighter," said Dave,
presently, and turned off the electric lights.
</p>

<p>
His father had his hand upon the glass side
of the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
"It is also growing warmer," motioned
the parent, in his sign language.
</p>

<p>
A mile and a half had been covered and now
the waters of the ocean were so clear and light
that they could see for a hundred feet about
them.
</p>

<p>
The water glistened and sparkled like diamonds
as it washed against the sides of the
diving bell.
</p>

<p>
"The light is growing brighter," observed
Dave, presently.  "Isn't it wonderful!"
</p>

<p>
They now felt they were approaching the
bottom of the Pacific, for the diving bell was
moving very slowly.  Soon they saw great,
ribbon-like grasses, the ends floating upward
past the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
At this Amos Fearless shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"We don't want to get caught in those
grasses," he signed.  "They may prove
worse than ropes of wire."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a slight jar on the bottom of the
diving bell told them that the machine had
struck something.  It no longer descended,
but wabbled from side to side.
</p>

<p>
At once Amos Fearless signaled through
the air-tube to stop lowering.  Then a small
glass trap was opened in the diving bell's
bottom.
</p>

<p>
Through this they saw what had caused
the machine to stop.  It was caught in the
top-most branches of a submarine tree.  Below
them, upon all sides, was a regular submarine
forest.
</p>

<p>
The trees were two to three hundred feet
tall, twisted and gnarled in all directions,
with branches stretching out of their sight.
</p>

<p>
Some of the trees boasted of most gorgeous
flowers, while from others floated what looked
like luscious fruits.
</p>

<p>
Below the trees could be seen strange
mosses and sponges, of every imaginable hue
and shape, and between them bushes and
creeping vines.
</p>

<p>
"This is a submarine paradise!" whispered
Dave.  "Did you ever dream of anything
so lovely?"
</p>

<p>
"Lovely&mdash;and dangerous!" came from
Amos Fearless.  And then he added: "I see
nothing of the <i>Happy Hour</i>."
</p>

<p>
He was right&mdash;there was no sign of a
sunken ship anywhere.
</p>

<p>
"Let us take the diving bell in a grand
circle around this spot," suggested Dave.
</p>

<p>
His father agreed, providing the thing
could be accomplished without positive danger.
</p>

<p>
To move around, they had to pull the machine
along from one tree-top to another by
means of the crab-like claws attached to the
bottom.
</p>

<p>
The diving bell worked like a charm and
soon a distance of several hundred yards had
been covered.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the crab-like claws would slip
on the tree-tops and at others the trees would
break off with a dull, snapping report.  When
this would happen the sap flowing from the
tree would be pure yellow in color.
</p>

<p>
In order to see at a great distance Amos
Fearless now adjusted a powerful light which
had been brought along, using a small
reflector behind it.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Dave let out a cry:
</p>

<p>
"The rival divers!"
</p>

<p>
He was right.  At a great distance he had
seen the other diving bell coming down.
</p>

<p>
It contained Vixen and Walton.  Bart
Hankers had said he was coming down with them,
but had backed out at the last moment, much
to the divers' satisfaction, for they had
counted that he would only be in their
way.
</p>

<p>
As swiftly as the other diving bell had
come into view, it now faded from sight beyond
another portion of the great submarine
forest.
</p>

<p>
"They are close upon our heels," muttered
Dave, and again Amos Fearless shook his
head, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
At last the diving bell gained the edge of
the forest and came to a rest upon one of the
banks of moss of many colors.
</p>

<p>
A short distance away the bank sloped
downward into a sort of valley.
</p>

<p>
Here it was darker, and what there was at
the bottom of the valley there was no telling
without an investigation.
</p>

<p>
Should they leave the diving bell upon an
exploring tour?
</p>

<p>
They debated the subject for several minutes.
</p>

<p>
It would be a risky thing to do, although
as yet they had encountered no strange fish
or marine monsters at this great depth.
</p>

<p>
With care they adjusted their diving suits
and then armed themselves with their knives
and submarine guns.
</p>

<p>
Then the door of the bell was opened slowly.
</p>

<p>
The pressure of the water became enormous
and their suits of steel creaked as if to
crash in upon them, as a shell can squeeze in
upon the inside of an egg.
</p>

<p>
But they had calculated upon all this, and
the suits held as expected.
</p>

<p>
When they stepped out upon the moss they
found it as soft and yielding as a thick velvet
carpet.
</p>

<p>
They advanced with caution toward the
edge of the slope before them, casting their
eyes continually upon all sides for the first
sign of danger.
</p>

<p>
They had thus gone a distance of two
hundred feet when Dave pointed to a mound to
their right.
</p>

<p>
He had seen something strange moving
among the moss.
</p>

<p>
Of a sudden the moss was uplifted like a
blanket and the young diver fell back in
amazement.
</p>

<p>
Before him stood a monster as startling as
it was horrible.
</p>

<p>
Whether it was fish, beast, or demon, he
could not tell, but it was certainly so awful
that his very heart appeared to stop beating
as he gazed upon it.
</p>

<p>
It had a long, round body, fat and blubbery,
with two legs in the center, two arms near the
neck, and at the end the tail of a fish.
</p>

<p>
The head was shaped like a huge pear, with
eyes blinking savagely from either side of a
nose which was as long and pointed as a cow's
horn.
</p>

<p>
The mouth of the demon was wide open,
showing a double row of sharp, bluish teeth
and a tongue covered with yellow slime.
</p>

<p>
All told, the creature was at least ten feet
long, and when it stood up it towered well
over the heads of the two divers.
</p>

<p>
On the instant Dave raised his gun, but his
father was before him, and a bullet from
Amos Fearless' submarine gun took the
demon squarely in the breast.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had the bullet reached its mark than
the demon uttered a roar which rang in the
divers' ears like thunder.
</p>

<p>
As if by magic the roar was answered from
half a dozen near-by places and the moss was
flung right and left.
</p>

<p>
The demons of the ocean's bottom had been
sleeping, and the roar had aroused them to a
sense of danger.
</p>

<p>
They came walking and swimming up from
every direction, and in a twinkle Amos
Fearless and Dave found themselves surrounded
and hopelessly cut off from the diving bell!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap29"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br><br>
THE ESCAPE FROM THE DEMONS
</h3>

<p>
It was a situation calculated to make the
stoutest heart quail.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless and Dave were surrounded
by the demons of the deep!
</p>

<p>
The horrible ocean monsters pressed close
upon them, their big eyes fairly starting from
their heads, their long arms working convulsively,
and their sweeping tails working the
brine up into a milk-white foam.
</p>

<p>
Evidently the battle-cry had gone forth, for
more monsters were coming up each instant.
</p>

<p>
Father and son looked at each other mutely.
Both felt that the end must be near.
</p>

<p>
The din increased, and being under water
was so painful to the two divers that they
almost fainted from the concussions.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of the uproar, however, there
came a sudden and dead silence.
</p>

<p>
Other monsters were approaching, leading
to the scene a monster larger than the rest.
It was the king of the submarine demons.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of the king all the others
fell back.
</p>

<p>
The king advanced, with eyes as staring as
his followers, but with a tail that was motionless.
</p>

<p>
Ten feet from Amos Fearless and Dave he
halted.
</p>

<p>
For a moment nothing was done upon
either side.
</p>

<p>
Evidently the king of the demons was
calculating the best manner of attacking the
strange objects which had appeared in his
realm.
</p>

<p>
He had seen the dead bodies of human beings,
but never had he beheld live human
beings, with skins of steel and rubber.
</p>

<p>
At last he came up cautiously and put out
one long and bony hand towards Dave.
</p>

<p>
The movement was so slow that Dave was
filled more with curiosity than with fear.
</p>

<p>
The king of the demons felt of Dave's legs,
his body and his arms.
</p>

<p>
Then he took hold of the submarine gun
and suddenly wrenched it from the young
diver's grasp.
</p>

<p>
With the gun he went back to his followers.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the demon that had been
shot was slowly dying, surrounded by a
number of his friends.
</p>

<p>
As soon as he was dead the others rent him
limb from limb and began to eat him up!
</p>

<p>
They were cannibals!
</p>

<p>
The king of the demons handled the gun he
had taken rather gingerly, nevertheless his
hand, or paw, struck the trigger, and the
submarine weapon was discharged full into the
face of another demon sitting near.
</p>

<p>
A wild sound immediately arose, and as the
shot demon fell back dead, several other
demons closed in upon the king.
</p>

<p>
Soon the monsters were fighting wildly
among themselves.  The water was dyed half
a dozen shades, shutting in the fighters as in
a cloud.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless touched Dave on the arm
and motioned his son to follow him.
</p>

<p>
The young diver understood, and in haste
the pair withdrew from the circle of combat.
</p>

<p>
Then they literally ran for the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
It was a fearful strain upon each, for their
diving suits weighed seventy-five pounds
apiece.
</p>

<p>
They were still a score of feet from the bell
when some of the demons saw them running
and started in pursuit.
</p>

<p>
"We are lost now!" thought Dave, but
continued to run, and urged his parent before
him.
</p>

<p>
At last both gained the diving bell, all but
exhausted.
</p>

<p>
Entering, they snapped the door shut and
sent the signal up.
</p>

<p>
Soon the bell was rising.  To assist, they
began to pump the water out of the bell.
</p>

<p>
The demons swarmed all around the bell,
but did not dare to touch the glass sides or
the crab-like claws.
</p>

<p>
Soon the bell passed from the zone of
submarine light and then the demons dropped
back, for they could not breathe in the upper
portions of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
The bell cleared of water, father and son
took off their diving suits.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven we are out of that!"
came in the sign language from Amos
Fearless.
</p>

<p>
"We were lucky to escape," answered
Dave, earnestly.  "But, father, the
treasure&mdash;how will we ever get at it, with those
demons around?"
</p>

<p>
At this the old diver shook his head slowly.
</p>

<p>
It was a problem difficult, if not impossible,
to solve.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't like to meet those fellows
again for a million dollars," went on Dave.
</p>

<p>
And his father agreed with him.
</p>

<p>
It seemed a long while before they emerged
from the ocean, at the side of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
Those on the ship lost no time in bringing
them on board and questioning them regarding
what they had discovered.
</p>

<p>
The story about the demons was listened
to with keen interest by Doctor Barrell.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, they must belong to the lost order
of chilusia damondaribytis!" cried the
learned man.  "They are supposed to have lived
at one time upon the lost continent of Atlantis.
But if so, how did they come here, in the
middle of the Pacific?  It is a great mystery.
You must bring up one of them in the net."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, but I don't want the job," replied
Dave, quickly.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear young man, think of the interest
to science&mdash;the&mdash;the great fame it will
bring you."
</p>

<p>
"Not if the chilu-what's-his-name chews
me up, doctor.  You just ought to see them.
Why, they are enough to give you bad dreams
for a month."
</p>

<p>
"Then I will go down myself in the diving
bell.  If it is light, as you say, perhaps I can
get some snapshot photographs of them,"
went on the learned man.
</p>

<p>
"What if they take it into their heads to
smash the diving bell to pieces?"
</p>

<p>
"Cannot you keep them at a distance with
the submarine firearms?"
</p>

<p>
"Hardly; but I was thinking we might
take down some submarine torpedoes," went
on Dave, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
The matter was talked over for fully an
hour, and at last it was decided that another
trial should be made the next day, and the
divers should take along two submarine
torpedoes, with which to blow up the demons
should the latter molest them.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime Captain Broadbeam had
his glass trained upon the <i>Raven</i>, and
presently he announced that the diving bell from
that ship was coming up.
</p>

<p>
All watched eagerly for the reappearance
of Vixen and Walton, the rival divers.
</p>

<p>
At last the men were hauled up on the deck
of the <i>Raven</i>.
</p>

<p>
It was seen that Walton was injured and
had to be carried to the cabin by some of the
sailors.
</p>

<p>
The rival divers had met only two of the
demons of the deep, but an awful conflict had
occurred, and Walton had had his left arm
nearly torn from the socket and was suffering
from the effects of the water which had
poured into his diving suit.
</p>

<p>
"I'll not go down again," announced
Vixen.  "Not for a thousand dollars a trip."
</p>

<p>
"What, you don't intend to give up the
search already?" cried Lemuel Hankers, in
horror.
</p>

<p>
"I do."
</p>

<p>
"But you agreed to find the <i>Happy Hour</i>,"
put in Bart.  "You must stick to your agreement."
</p>

<p>
"It's wuss nor putting your head into a
lion's mouth," persisted Cal Vixen.  "If you
don't believe it, go down yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I will go down&mdash;if you'll go with me,"
said Bart.  He was so anxious to get the
Washington fortune that his former timidity
was overcome.
</p>

<p>
Vixen held out all day about going down
again, but several drinks of liquor at last
made him bolder, and he agreed to try once
more, providing Bart would go with him, and
providing the bell was stored with explosives
with which to fight off the demons if they
showed themselves again.
</p>

<p>
The day proved cloudy, and it looked as if
a storm were brewing.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't reckon we'll get it right
away," said Captain Broadbeam.  "And if
you want to get ahead of the <i>Raven's</i> crowd
you had better go down.  I see they are
getting ready to put their bell over again."
</p>

<p>
At half-past nine the <i>Swallow's</i> diving bell
was hoisted into the Pacific once more, and
Dave and his father entered it.
</p>

<p>
"We may never see you again, captain,"
said the young diver.  "If we don't, good-by!"
</p>

<p>
A minute later the diving bell disappeared
beneath the surface of the mighty Pacific.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
<br><br>
IN A DIVING BELL
</h3>

<p>
Down and down went the bell.
</p>

<p>
The spot chosen was about five hundred
feet to the northward of where the bell had
gone down before&mdash;directly over the valley
the divers had discovered.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless was of the opinion that if
the <i>Happy Hour</i> was at all in that vicinity
she must lie at the bottom of the valley.
</p>

<p>
The dark zone of waters was passed, and
now they came into the light once more.
</p>

<p>
The water was warm and as clear as crystal,
showing nothing of the dye and foam produced
by the battle of the deep-sea monsters.
</p>

<p>
A number of curious fish sailed past the
diving bell&mdash;fish which they had not seen
before.
</p>

<p>
One was jet-black and shaped exactly like
a pillow tied in the middle.
</p>

<p>
Another was red, white, and blue, with six
eyes which shone like stars of silver.
</p>

<p>
"That's a regular starry-flag fish," was
Dave's comment.  "I wonder if we can take
the sight of that for a good sign?"
</p>

<p>
"Let us hope so," answered Amos Fearless,
in his sign language.
</p>

<p>
The old diver's voice was gradually
improving, and that morning he had spoken a
few words to Dave in a hoarse whisper.
</p>

<p>
At last they came in sight of that mossy
plain, which, the day before, had almost been
the scene of their death.
</p>

<p>
The diving bell was halted and they gazed
around sharply for some sign of the demons.
</p>

<p>
Not a monster of the deep was in sight.
</p>

<p>
The moss was torn up on all sides, and
here and there lay parts of bodies and bones,
but that was all.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they all killed each other,"
suggested Dave.
</p>

<p>
"Let us hope so," came from his father.
</p>

<p>
The mossy plain was now passed, and gradually
the diving bell slipped down the slope
of the valley beyond.
</p>

<p>
Here the light was not so good and they
had to turn on the electricity.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the valley grew a number
of submarine trees and bushes, with vines
which sent up their swaying bodies several
hundreds of feet into the crystal-like water.
</p>

<p>
At last the diving bell came to a stop at
the very bottom of the valley, among the
trees.
</p>

<p>
They signaled to stop lowering and then
brought out a tiny searchlight which had
been brought along.
</p>

<p>
This was swept in every direction.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Dave uttered an exclamation:
</p>

<p>
"Look!  There is something which
resembles a ship's stern!"
</p>

<p>
The young diver was right.  Far down the
valley his eye had beheld some woodwork,
half buried in the muck and moss.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes both father and son were
working the claw-like feet of the diving bell
and moving toward the wreckage in crab-like
fashion.
</p>

<p>
As they advanced they saw a dark object
above them coming down swiftly.
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless caught his son by the arm
and both drew back.
</p>

<p>
Then Dave gave a start.
</p>

<p>
The dark object was the diving bell from
the <i>Raven</i>!
</p>

<p>
The bell contained Cal Vixen, Lemuel
Hankers, and Bart.
</p>

<p>
Dave motioned to his father in the sign
language of the divers:
</p>

<p>
"Come, let us get to the wreck first."
</p>

<p>
Amos Fearless caught his son by the arm
and moved forward once more.
</p>

<p>
But the rival diving bell was between them
and their object, and they had to make a
semicircle with their own diving bell.
</p>

<p>
The rivals now saw the bell from the
<i>Swallow</i>, and as both bells came closer,
Lemuel Hankers shook his fist at the Fearlesses.
</p>

<p>
"You're a cheerful enemy," was Dave's
dry comment.
</p>

<p>
Soon our friends were close to the wreckage,
and Dave gave a shout:
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Happy Hour</i>!  See, the name is on
the stern!"
</p>

<p>
He was right, the wreck was indeed that
of the ship for which they had searched so
long.
</p>

<p>
The second diving bell now came up and
came to a standstill directly at the side of
the wreck.
</p>

<p>
But Dave was the first on board, and as
Vixen approached he motioned to the rival
diver in the sign language:
</p>

<p>
"We claim this wreck, which we discovered first."
</p>

<p>
"We claim the wreck," returned Cal
Vixen.
</p>

<p>
And he made several motions to Lemuel
Hankers and his son.
</p>

<p>
It soon looked as if there would be a fight
then and there, but this would have been
suicidal for all hands.
</p>

<p>
Yet when Dave and his father tried to enter
the cabin of the <i>Happy Hour</i>, Cal Vixen
attempted to bar their way.
</p>

<p>
Instantly Amos Fearless seized the rival
diver and hurled him back.
</p>

<p>
"Touch me or my son and you will pay
dearly for it," he motioned to Vixen.
</p>

<p>
At this the rival diver fell back, knowing
full well that Amos Fearless was not a
person with whom to trifle.
</p>

<p>
Slowly and cautiously Dave entered the
cabin of the <i>Happy Hour</i>.
</p>

<p>
His father followed, and at a respectable
distance came Cal Vixen and the two Hankers.
</p>

<p>
The cabin was badly wrecked, and in it
nothing of value remained.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if we can get down into the
hold," thought Dave, and motioned to his
father.
</p>

<p>
"We will try," came back from the old
diver.  "But be careful, or you won't get
out alive."
</p>

<p>
The pair advanced with great caution,
going down through the forward hatch.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the rival party entered the
hold by the rear hatch.
</p>

<p>
It was very dark, and the electric light
shone but dimly here, for the water was so
foul it contaminated the air they carried.
</p>

<p>
To the intense surprise of all, the hold of
the <i>Happy Hour</i> was absolutely bare!
</p>

<p>
Dave could scarcely believe the evidence of
his senses.
</p>

<p>
The great treasure was gone!
</p>

<p>
Their trip to the middle of the Pacific and
to the bottom of that mighty ocean had
availed them nothing.
</p>

<p>
Father and son stared helplessly at each
other and then at the rival party.
</p>

<p>
All were equally dumfounded.
</p>

<p>
The rage of the Hankers knew no bounds.
</p>

<p>
Lemuel Hankers would not believe the
truth, and had Cal Vixen go with him and
Bart on a thorough search throughout the
wreck, and all around it.
</p>

<p>
It was useless; the <i>Happy Hour</i> and the
vicinity were absolutely bare of the first trace
of gold, or, in fact, of anything of value.
</p>

<p>
With heavy hearts the Hankers party returned
to their diving bell.
</p>

<p>
"The jig is up!" cried Bart, as soon as
he was inside and could speak.  "Oh, what
a sell!"
</p>

<p>
"I was mad to believe in it!" came from
Lemuel Hankers.  "And to think that I have
spent thousands of dollars on a fool's;
errand!"  And tears of miserly rage flowed
down his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon we might as well go up," put in
Cal Vixen.  He, too, was disgusted.
</p>

<p>
They gave the signal, and gradually their
diving bell began to leave the valley at the
ocean's bottom.
</p>

<p>
But less than quarter of a mile of the
distance to the surface was covered when there
came a shock on top of the diving bell which,
sent all inside sprawling headlong.
</p>

<p>
Then came another shock and the water
began to pour into the bell.
</p>

<p>
Some great monster of the deep had hit the
bell and cracked some of the upper joints.
</p>

<p>
The collision showed those above that
something was wrong, and they began to haul
in faster than ever.
</p>

<p>
But great damage had been done also to
the monster, which was somewhat similar to
a deep-sea whale.
</p>

<p>
He became entangled in the guide line of
the diving bell and was hauled up to the
surface in spite of himself.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, what's this?" cried Captain
Nesik, when the monster came into view.
</p>

<p>
Then ensued a battle royal for fully five
minutes.
</p>

<p>
At last the monster was cut loose and
disappeared, with a loud splash, into the ocean.
</p>

<p>
Then the diving bell was hoisted aboard
and opened.
</p>

<p>
It was found that those inside had been
almost drowned, and all were unable to help
themselves and had to be carried to the ship's
cabin.  Here they lingered for many hours
between life and death.
</p>

<p>
The diving bell was ruined, and it was
doubtful if another search for the treasure
could be made by the Hankers' party.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI
<br><br>
THE TREASURE AT LAST&mdash;CONCLUSION
</h3>

<p>
Little dreaming of the accident which had
overtaken their rivals, Amos Fearless and
Dave returned to their own diving bell.
</p>

<p>
The heart of each was heavy, and for
several minutes neither felt like speaking.
</p>

<p>
"A wild-goose chase," said the old diver
at last.  "I might have known it would prove
so."
</p>

<p>
"But what has become of the gold!" returned
Dave.  "It couldn't walk off of itself."
</p>

<p>
"That is true.  Perhaps those on board of
the <i>Happy Hour</i> took it off, when they found
the ship was about to sink."
</p>

<p>
"But they never brought any of the treasure
to land."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;at least, none that was reported.
They might have done such a thing in
secret."
</p>

<p>
"Supposing we move the bell around and
make another search," suggested Dave.
"The demons appear to have vanished."
</p>

<p>
They pumped in a fresh supply of air and
then moved around in a large circle.
</p>

<p>
It was hard work, and the confinement of
the diving bell gave each a headache and a
strange ringing in the ears.
</p>

<p>
Presently they came to a curiously shaped
mound of shells, covered with moss.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, what's this?" said Dave.  "Hang
me if it doesn't look like the home of some
submarine animal.  Perhaps it's a meeting
house for those demons."
</p>

<p>
"If it is, we had better move on," replied
Amos Fearless, in the sign language.
</p>

<p>
But Dave was curious to investigate, and
presently they replaced their helmets, took in
some fresh air, and sallied forth to examine
the mound.
</p>

<p>
Inside all was damp&mdash;a dampness different
from that produced by the water around
them.
</p>

<p>
The mound proved to be hollow, with the
walls covered with brilliant seashells of all
colors.
</p>

<p>
At the top was a round hole to admit light.
</p>

<p>
In the center was a smaller mound, with a
curious hump in the middle.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing here," signed Amos Fearless,
when of a sudden something glittering caught
Dave's eye.
</p>

<p>
He stooped and picked up&mdash;a gold coin!
</p>

<p>
In a moment he was digging away at the
small mound in the center of the shell-like
structure.
</p>

<p>
The moss came away readily, and to their
gaze was disclosed&mdash;a heap of shining
gold!
</p>

<p>
"The treasure!" burst from the young
diver.  "Found at last!"
</p>

<p>
His father was equally pleased.
</p>

<p>
The gold was mixed with bits of other
bright metal and glass, for whoever had
stored it there had known no difference in
value and had simply made a collection of
stuff bright to the eye.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go back and fill up the diving
bell," said Amos Fearless, by signs.
</p>

<p>
Dave was more than willing, and they soon
had the diving bell as close as possible to the
door of the mound.
</p>

<p>
They had brought several bags along, and
into these they began heaping the gold.
</p>

<p>
It was hard work, but this they did not mind.
</p>

<p>
The finding of the treasure meant to them
a lifetime of leisure, had they a mind to take
it.
</p>

<p>
At last the bags were full and still more of
the gold remained.
</p>

<p>
"We will pile it on the floor of the diving
bell," signed Amos Fearless.  "Let us make
one trip of it.  After this I never wish to visit
the bottom of the sea again."
</p>

<p>
Both worked steadily, and in half an hour
had every piece of gold in sight picked up.
</p>

<p>
They were just taking the last of the gold
to the diving bell when a horrible roar broke
upon their ears.
</p>

<p>
The demons of the deep were returning to
the locality.
</p>

<p>
"Quick!" cried Dave.  "Or it will be all
up with us!"
</p>

<p>
Father and son ran for the diving bell.
</p>

<p>
But now the demons saw them and the roar
increased.
</p>

<p>
Soon fully fifty of the ferocious creatures
were leaping and swimming toward the
mound.
</p>

<p>
Their sharp teeth clicked together as if
anxious to bury themselves in the bodies of
the human beings.
</p>

<p>
With all haste Amos Fearless and Dave
got into the diving bell.  But before they
could close the door one of the demons was
upon them.
</p>

<p>
He caught the old diver by the head, intending
to pull that member from the rest of
the body.
</p>

<p>
Dave's heart leaped into his throat, yet his
presence of mind did not desert him.
</p>

<p>
Raising one of the submarine guns he
blazed away and caught the monster of the
deep straight in the mouth and throat.
</p>

<p>
Mortally wounded, the demon fell back, one
arm still within the doorway of the diving
bell.
</p>

<p>
As quickly as possible Amos Fearless
turned and shoved the arm outside.
</p>

<p>
Dave was about to close the door when his
father motioned him to desist.
</p>

<p>
Then the old diver caught up one of the
torpedoes which had been brought along, set
its clock-like movements in motion, and
hurled it forth among the approaching
company of demons.
</p>

<p>
It fell in their midst, and, attracted by the
shining metallic covering of the torpedo, all
crowded around the object.
</p>

<p>
As they did this, the door of the diving bell
was closed and the signal was sent up to hoist
away immediately.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had the diving bell begun to move
when a fearful shock made it quiver from
top to bottom and cracked one of the glass
sides.
</p>

<p>
The torpedo had exploded, dealing death
and destruction among the demons of the
deep, impossible to describe.
</p>

<p>
Fully a score of the monsters were utterly
annihilated, while nearly every one of the
others was badly wounded.
</p>

<p>
One that escaped came after the diving
bell, trying vainly to destroy the bell and
those inside.
</p>

<p>
But an unlucky movement caused the
demon to come in contact with one of the
crab-like claws of the bell, and seeing this,
Dave worked the claw instantly, thus making
the demon a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
The creature flopped violently, but as the
bell ascended to the upper waters of the
ocean, it seemed to become stunned, and
before the surface was gained it lay utterly
helpless.
</p>

<p>
Soon the diving bell was hoisted aboard
of the <i>Swallow</i>.
</p>

<p>
"The gold at last!" cried Captain Broadbeam.
"Hurrah!  I was afraid something
awful had happened."
</p>

<p>
"And the wonderful monster," put in
Doctor Barrell.  "What an odd creature!  It
will make a grand exhibition at the
Smithsonian Institution."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to pickle him in alcohol,
doctor," said Dave, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
Both Amos Fearless and Dave were very
weak from having remained at the ocean's
bottom so long, and it was several days
before either felt entirely like himself again.
</p>

<p>
Strange to say, however, the trip after the
treasure had helped Mr. Fearless' organs of
speech, and soon he could talk almost as well
as ever.
</p>

<p>
"This is the best yet," declared Dave.
"It's better than finding the treasure."
</p>

<p>
"I am thankful from the bottom of my
heart," answered the old diver, and his face
showed that he spoke the truth.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think that I want to go to the
bottom of the Pacific again, father."
</p>

<p>
"Nor I, Dave.  It is too full of perils."
</p>

<p>
The storm that had been threatening broke
the next day, and was a great strain on the
<i>Swallow</i> and likewise on the <i>Raven</i>.  The
latter ship sprung a leak, and the <i>Swallow</i>
stood by, ready to offer assistance if she
should go down.
</p>

<p>
During that time those on the <i>Raven</i> heard
of the finding of the treasure.
</p>

<p>
"I claim half of that treasure," said
Lemuel Hankers.
</p>

<p>
"You'll never get it," replied Amos Fearless,
firmly.
</p>

<p>
When the two ships separated it was
discovered by those on the <i>Swallow</i> that Pete
Rackley was missing.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what I think!" said Dave.
"I think he escaped to the <i>Raven</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let him go," said Captain Broadbeam.
"We can well afford to do without him."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think the Hankers will make any
further trouble for us?" asked Dave of his
father.
</p>

<p>
"That remains to be seen," answered
Amos Fearless.  The Hankers and their
friends did try to make trouble, and how will
to be told in another volume, to be called "Dave
Fearless on a Floating Island; or, The Cruise of
the Treasure Ship."
</p>

<p>
After the storm the weather became pleasant,
and then Captain Broadbeam began the long
journey home.
